<h1>Visiting Shropshire's Churches</h1>
<p>The plan is to visit all (Church of England) churches in Shropshire that were built prior to the end of the Victorian era.</p>
<p>A total of 317 sites to visit have been identified.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In 1912 the Rev D H S Cranage published the book: <i>An Architectural Account of the Churches of Shropshire</i>, in this book 311 churches in Shropshire are described.</p>
<p>In 2004 (and 2013 with colour photos) John Leonard published the book: <i>The Churches of Shropshire & their treasures</i>, in this later book 322 strictly Anglican churches in Shropshire are described.  Of these churches, 11 have been excluded as they either are now private dwellings, or were built post the Victorian era.</p>
<p>In addition, 4 Abbeys (Shrewsbury, Haughmond, Buildwas and Lilleshall) and 2 Priorys (Wenlock and White Ladies) have been added to the list.</p>
<p>The number of churches and whether they have been visited or not are shown in the chart below.</p>
<p>The location of each church is also shown on a <a href="#churchmap">Google Map</a> below.</p>
