# Internal Features

## Introduction

Churches contain many interesting, historical and valuable features and artefacts with artwork and symbolism relating to the spiritual life of the church. The features and artifacts to look out for are itemised on this page.

## Altar

The altar is the heart of the church. It usually stands at the east end of the chancel or presbytery, in an area known as the sanctuary. The altar has two principal symbolic meanings. First, it is a sacrificial altar. Christian writers saw Jesus as a sacrificed lamb in his crucifixion and the altar remembers that sacrifice. Second, it is a table for a communal meal, remembering the last supper. The altar is frequently marked by five crosses, referring to the five wounds of Christ.

## Altar Rail

The altar rail (also known as a communion rail or chancel rail) is a low barrier, sometimes ornate and usually made of stone, wood or metal in some combination, delimiting the chancel and the sanctuary.

One theory is that communion rails came into use for the very practical purpose of keeping dogs and other stray animals away from the altar area, at a time when bringing such animals into the church would not have been uncommon.

## Aumbry

An aumbry is a small, secure chest or cupboard in a wall, usually the north wall near to the altar. It houses the sacred vessels used during the service and communion. Today, aumbries are often used to store the Blessed Sacrament.

## Bells

A church bell in Christian architecture is a bell which is rung in a church for a variety of religious purposes, and can be heard outside the building. Traditionally they are used to call worshippers to the church for a communal service, and to announce the fixed times of daily Christian prayer, called the canonical [^1] hours, which number seven and are contained in breviaries. They are also rung on special occasions such as a wedding, or a funeral service. In some religious traditions they are used within the liturgy of the church service to signify to people that a particular part of the service has been reached. The ringing of church bells, in the Christian tradition, is also believed to drive out demons.

The traditional European church bell used in Christian churches worldwide consists of a cup-shaped metal resonator with a pivoted clapper hanging inside which strikes the sides when the bell is swung. It is hung within a steeple or belltower of a church or religious building, so the sound can reach a wide area. Such bells are either fixed in position (“hung dead”) or hung from a pivoted beam (the “headstock”) so they can swing to and fro. A rope hangs from a lever or wheel attached to the headstock, and when the bell ringer pulls on the rope the bell swings back and forth and the clapper hits the inside, sounding the bell. Bells that are hung dead are normally sounded by hitting the sound bow with a hammer or occasionally by a rope which pulls the internal clapper against the bell.

A church may have a single bell, or a collection of bells which are tuned to a common scale. They may be stationary and chimed, rung randomly by swinging through a small arc, or swung through a full circle to enable the high degree of control of English change ringing.

Before modern communications, church bells were a common way to call the community together for all purposes, both sacred and secular.

[^1]: In the practice of Christianity, canonical hours mark the divisions of the day in terms of fixed times of prayer at regular intervals. A book of hours (The book of hours is a Christian devotional book popular in the Middle Ages. It is the most common type of surviving medieval illuminated manuscript. Like every manuscript, each manuscript book of hours is unique in one way or another, but most contain a similar collection of texts, prayers and psalms, often with appropriate decorations, for Christian devotion.), chiefly a breviary (A breviary (Latin: breviarium) is a liturgical book used in Christianity for praying the canonical hours, usually recited at seven fixed prayer times.), normally contains a version of, or selection from, such prayers. In Anglicanism, they are often known as the daily or divine office, to distinguish them from the other ‘offices’ of the Church (holy communion, baptism, etc.), which are commonly observed weekly or less often.

## Chained Bible

King Henry VIII declared that a large copy of the English Bible should be set up on a lectern in every parish church in England, so that the poor as well as the rich might hear the Word of the Lord.

To guard against theft, the bibles were chained securely.

## Chancel Arch

The arched opening in the east wall of the nave, providing access to the chancel. The chancel arch is often decorated with carving, which may once have been painted.

## Easter Sepulchre

Easter is the most important festival of the Christian year.  An Easter sepulchre is an arched recess, usually in the north wall of the sanctuary.  It is used during the annual Easter ceremonies as it is symbolic of Jesus’ burial in the tomb following the crucifixion.

A crucifix and other sacred elements were placed in the sepulchre from Good Friday until Easter Day.  The sepulchre was generally set into the north wall of the chancel.  Such sepulchres often resemble canopied tombs, with elaborate carved frontals and highly decorative canopies.  Easter Sepulchres are found only in England, and generally date from the Decorated Gothic period, roughly 13th and 14th centuries.

Easter Sepulchres are relatively rare, as most were destroyed during the Reformation.  In some cases elaborate tombs are identified as possible sepulchres but such identification is impossible to verify, especially in cases where the carving is worn or partially destroyed.

## Floor Tiles

## Font

Every medieval church contained a font. It was close to the main entrance of the church in an area known as the baptistry. The font is placed by the entrance as it symbolises the start of a new life as a Christian. Baptism represents leaving behind the past and committing to God for the future. Today, fonts may be found elsewhere in the church.

The word font is derived from the Latin word 'fons' which means spring.

The font contains the holy water used in Baptism. They were originally large enough to allow the infant to be fully immersed, but in the middle ages it became the practice to baptise by partial immersion or pouring water over the head.

In 1236 it was ordered that all fonts should have a lockable lid to prevent the theft of the holy water.

## Great Rood

A rood is a carved image of Christ on the cross, made of wood or stone. The medieval 'great rood' was a carved and painted crucifix, erected on a pedestal above the rood screen. It had the figures of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St John the Evangelist on either side of Jesus on the cross.

![](attachments/2021-05-29_14_07_49_DSC02633.jpg)

## Green Man

The Green Man is one of the most powerful and enduring pagan symbols and was originally a Celtic fertility symbol.

Green Men are found in a variety of forms in the ornamental stonework and woodwork of churches. They are male heads peering through foliage, which is often growing from their eyes, mouth, ears and nostrils. They are usually found on roof bosses, capitals, corbels and misericords.

## Hatchment

A hatchment is a diamond-shaped board made of wood or wood and canvas.

It bears the arms, crest or motto of a deceased person.

Hatchments were carried in front of funeral processions to the church, and afterwards hung on the gate of the deceased person's house. After it had been hung on the gates for several months, it was taken down and hung in the church.

## Instruments of Christ’s Passion

Representations of the Instruments of Christ’s Passion are displayed in many churches, with the object of remembering Christ’s suffering for the redemption of mankind. These can be in stained glass windows, on roof bosses, on reredos screens, or painted onto a number of small shields. Instruments shown include the cross, the crown of thorns, lances, hammer and nails, scourges, and the robe which Christ wore.

## Kneeler

A kneeler is a cushion (also called a tuffet or hassock) or a piece of furniture used for resting in a kneeling position during Christian prayer.

In many churches, pews are equipped with kneelers in front of the seating bench so members of the congregation can kneel on them instead of the floor. In a few other situations, such as confessionals and areas in front of an altar, kneelers for kneeling during prayer or sacraments may also be used. Traditionally, altar rails often have built-in knee cushions to facilitate reception of Holy Communion while kneeling.

Kneelers in churches are a modern development. Kneeling was not part of the Mass in early Christianity, and has been part of the Catholic Mass only since the 16th century.

## Lectern

The lectern is a reading desk on which the bible rests.

It is usually made from brass or wood, and is moveable. Brass lecterns are usually in the shape of an eagle with outstretched wings. The eagle often stands on a ball which represents the world, while the bible on the eagle's back symbolises the gospel being carried to the corners of the earth.

## Memorials

The ‘great and good’ of society enjoyed the privilege of being commemorated within their parish churches. It should be remembered that monuments do not necessarily mark the place of interment, which may be some distance away.

Monuments can provide a wealth of information concerning those remembered; wealth, fashion, their appearance, the way people lived, and how they hoped to be remembered. Memorials vary in size from large, elaborate, canopied monuments to modest tablets fixed to the church wall. From the beginning of the 13th century the image was often placed on a tomb chest and carved in the form of a three dimensional effigy.

## Miscellaneous / Unknown

Churches contain many and varied treasures.

![](attachments/2020-11-21_15_43_01_DSC_9112.jpg)

## Misericord

Some church stalls have misericords. They are hinged, tip up wooden seats which, when up, have a second smaller seat on the underside for the user to rest on when standing position. Sometimes the misericord seat has carved decorations.

![](attachments/2021-06-12_10_59_23_DSC02713.jpg)

## Organ

The pipe organ is one of the oldest of all instruments and may pre-date Christianity by around 1000 years or so. It wasn’t until around 900AD that we find organs being used for church worship and exactly how or why is unclear, however, it was probably for ceremonial purposes initially. By the 1400’s organs appear to be well established in monastic churches and cathedrals throughout Europe.

![](attachments/2021-12-27_13_57_33_DSC_0705.jpg)

## Parish Chest

For hundreds of years, large chests with slots in the top were used for the collecting alms. Chests were also used for keeping parish registers, accounts, and other records.

They usually had three or more locks, each with a separate key held by a different person. All had to be present to unlock the chest.

![](attachments/2021-12-29_14_20_14_DSC_0742.jpg)

## Piscina

The Latin word 'piscina' literally means fish pond.

The piscina is a niche containing a shallow stone basin with a drain hole. It was used for disposing of the holy water used to wash the communion vessels during the service. A double piscina also has a bowl for the priest to wash his hands.

## Poppyhead

Poppyheads are ornaments, often found on top of the upright end of seats and benches. They may be carved in the shape of figures, animals, beasts, foliage, or a number of other shapes.

![](attachments/2021-06-12_11_01_10_DSC02714.jpg)

## Pulpit

A pulpit is a raised stand for preachers in a Christian church. The origin of the word is the Latin pulpitum (platform or staging). The oldest mention of a pulpit in England dates from the 12th century. The oldest example still in existence is believed to date from about 1330. In the 15th century, only a fifth of churches had a pulpit, but in 1603 they were made compulsory.

![](attachments/2020-01-04_15_02_01_DSC_6107.jpg)

## Reredos

Behind the altar may be a reredos screen. It can be a curtain, a picture or carvings in stone or wood. Sometimes it has niches containing figures of saints.

![](attachments/2020-11-21_15_53_01_DSC_9129.jpg)

## Rood Loft

Many medieval churches had a rood loft, or singing gallery, on top of the rood screen. It was often supported by a coving. In most cases the only evidence left that these existed are the blocked up doorways that led to them.

## Rood Screen

In medieval churches, the rood screen was a decorative stone or wooden screen which separated the nave from the chancel, and had a central gate. Most were pierced with a lattice work of carved wood and richly decorated. Other screens were used to separate chapels from the chancel or aisles.

![](attachments/2021-06-05_15_41_27_DSC02692.jpg)

## Roof Boss

A boss is a decoration in stone or wood where cross members of a roof or ceiling intersect. Many are elaborately carved, and popular subjects include grotesque and human faces, green men, symbols of Christ’s passion, heraldic shields, foliage and animals. For most of them, the original paintwork has long since gone, to be replaced in some cases by a covering of gilt paint.

## Royal Coats of Arms

After the Pope granted Henry VIII the title 'Defender of the Faith', Royal coats of arms of the king or queen of the day were hung in churches. They were there to remind congregations of the link between the church and the state.

![](attachments/2021-09-17_13_15_04_DSC_0364.jpg)

## Seating

For centuries there was no seating in the nave, although a stone ledge was sometimes provided for the elderly and infirm; ‘the weakest go to the wall’.

With the increase in preaching came the need for seating. By the late 16th century an increasing number of churches had installed permanent benches.

Rows of benches are often erroneously referred to as pews. Pews are actually enclosed structures, and of a much later date and had doors to protect from drafts. These ‘box pews’ were sometimes provided with armchairs and cushions and perhaps even a stove and curtains.

![](attachments/2021-12-29_14_34_52_DSC_0772.jpg)

## Sedilia

These are recessed seats, usually three, for priests. They are usually set into the south wall of the chancel, are made of stone and may be canopied.

![](attachments/2021-10-15_11_13_03_DSC03166.jpg)

## Stained Glass

Stained glass is used to add beauty and colour to churches. Often windows show biblical scenes.

Most medieval stained glass was lost following the Reformation and during the Civil War, when it was smashed by the iconoclasts [^2].

There was a revival of interest in stained glass during the Victorian era, and much of what we see today is from that time. Victorian stained glass was usually installed as a memorial to local people or to commemorate significant events.

![](attachments/2021-12-27_13_54_57_DSC_0698.jpg)

[^2]: Iconoclasm is the social belief in the importance of the destruction of icons and other images or monuments, most frequently for religious or political reasons. People who engage in or support iconoclasm are called iconoclasts, a term that has come to be figuratively applied to any individual who challenges cherished beliefs or venerated institutions on the grounds that they are erroneous or pernicious.

## Stations of the Cross

Sometimes depicted in a series of paintings or carvings round the walls of a church. They represent the fourteen incidents which occurred in Christ’s last journey from His meeting with Pilate to His entombment. During a devotion of the same name, each station is visited in turn.

## Tabernacle

For those Christian traditions which practice the rite known as Eucharist or Holy Communion, a tabernacle or sacrament house is a fixed, locked box in which the Eucharist (consecrated communion hosts) is stored as part of the “reserved sacrament” rite. A container for the same purpose, which is set directly into a wall, is called an aumbry.

## Wall Painting

In the middle ages, the interior walls of churches were like picture books of painted plaster. They were used as visual aids for the illiterate congregation. Walls were covered with murals depicting saints and scenes from the scriptures.
