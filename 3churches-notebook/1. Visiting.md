# Visiting

In 1912 the Rev D H S Cranage (1866-1957) published:

"An Architectural Account of the Churches of Shropshire"

(Published by Hobson & Co, Wellington Shropshire (1912))

In which 311 churches in Shropshire were described.

In 2004 (and 2013 with colour photos) John Leonard published:

"The Churches of Shropshire & their treasures"

This book identifies 324 churches.

The following have been excluded:
