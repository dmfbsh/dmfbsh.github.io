<name>Acton Burnell - St Mary</name>
<desc>Date: 1275 AD
This church is considered to be the finest Early English (13th Century) church in Shropshire.  Unlike most English parish churches, Acton Burnell is built in a same style throughout.

It features a corbel-table with many grotesque carvings (a corbel-table is a continuous row of corbels, and a corbel is a block of stone projecting from a wall and supporting some heavy feature).

Acton generally means 'settlement (farm or estate) by the oaks' and this estate belonged to Robert Burnell an English bishop who served as Lord Chancellor of England from 1274 to 1292.</desc>

<desc>Date: 12th to 14th Century AD
This is a church that has suffered at the hands of 19th Century restorers.  Much of the masonry is medieval, but the windows were all renewed in the 19th Century.  The porch was added in 1722 and the north chapel in 1820.

Acton generally means 'settlement (farm or estate) by the oaks' and the 'Scott' originates from the medieval name Reynold le. Scot who held a share in the manor in 1255.

The settlement was registered as Actune in the Domesday Book.</desc>

Norman origin, extensively rebuilt 1801

======
Date: 1635-1636 AD
The oldest existing part of the present church is the north transept, which was built in 1635-36 as a burial chapel for the Needham family, the Viscounts Kilmorey of Shavington.  The other remaining part of the older church is the tower, built in 1712.  The rest of the church was built in 1801 by Richard Baker; it is the only known work by this architect.

The cast iron window frames were made locally at Coalbrookdale.

The name of the village derives from the Old English meaning 'Ealdthryth's wood/clearing', a leah (Old English) is a forest, wood, glade or clearing; (later) a pasture or a meadow.</desc>

Saxon Collegiate church founded between 7th and 10th C

Reconsecrated 1290

Nave thought to have finest example of a late medieval roof in Shropshire

Impressive Saddleback tower c1200

Loton Chapel added 1320 contains Burne-Jones window
======
Date: 1290 AD
The church is thought to have been founded between the 7th and 10th Centuries.  It was originally a Minster Church (Minster was the Anglo-Saxon version of a monastery, and was originally applied to churches served by monks / clergy living a communal life and endowed by a charter with the obligation of maintaining the daily office of prayer, but was not the seat of a bishop and the church had no diocesan responsibilities).

In the mid-12th century the church was given Shrewsbury Abbey, but was later assigned to Alberbury Priory.  The priory was founded in 1228 and was one of three dependencies of the French abbey of Grandmont (the priory itself was sited about one and a quarter miles away by the river Severn).  Being an 'alien' priory it was vulnerable to predators representing the king, the priory was finally suppressed by the king in 1441 and the estate passed to All Souls' college, Oxford.

The church was reconsecrated in 1290, following the cessation of a long-running series of Welsh border disputes.

The tower is Early English (approx. 1180 to 1270), it has a saddleback roof (a ridge and two sloping sides) - the only example of such in Shropshire.

The roof of the nave is thought to be one of the finest in the county.

The Loton Chapel was added in 1320, and contains a pre-Raphaelite window by Burne Jones.

There are two wall-monuments to Sir Richard Lyster, who was MP for Shrewsbury in the 18th Century, the imagery on one refers to a scene in the House of Commons when he protested against a decision of the House.

The place name derives from the Old English 'burh' (a fortified place) and the personal name Aluburg or Ealhburg.</desc>

<name>Atcham - St Eata</name>
<desc>Date: Before 1075 AD
This is the only church in England dedicated to St Eata of Hexham.

The first church to St Eata is said to have been built in the 8th Century but there is no longer any trace of this.  The present church has been on this site since at least 1075, this is known because the chronicler Orderic Vitalis (a Benedictine monk who wrote one of the great chronicles of 11th and 12th Century England) was baptised at the church on Easter Day in 1075.

The oldest part of the present church is the nave which dates from the late Saxon or early Norman period.  The tower is probably late 12th Century, the chancel late 13th Century and the south porch is dated 1665.  The church was restored in the late 19th Century.

The church is constructed from red and grey sandstone and incorporates some large blocks from the Roman city of Wroxeter.

The name Atcham is a contraction of Attingham, meaning 'the home of Eata's people'.</desc>

<name>Baschurch - All Saints</name>
<desc>Date: 12th Century
Some parts of the church are Norman (and date from the 12th Century).  The bottom four stages of the tower were constructed in the early 13th Century.  The top stage was added in circa 1400.

The church was restored in 1790 by Thomas Telford.  Further restorations were carried out in the late 19th Century.

The font dates from 1681, and there are monuments to Thomas Corbet, dated 1615, and Thomas Slaney M.P. for Shrewsbury, who served in eight parliaments.  There is also is an old chained Bible, given in 1770 by the Rev. Robert Jeffreys, vicar here for 58 years, who died in 1800.

The stained glass in the east window is by Kempe (1886).

The English name Baschurch first appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Bascherche, but the earliest references to Baschurch are under its Welsh name Eglwyssau Bassa (Churches of Bassa), in a seven-stanza englyn-poem of the same name found in the Welsh cycle of poems called Canu Heledd, generally thought to date to the ninth century.</desc>

<name>Battlefield - St Mary Magdalene</name>
<desc>Date: 1406 AD
The church was built just after the Battle of Shrewsbury as a chantry - a place of intercession and commemoration for those killed in the fighting.  The building is probably constructed over a mass burial pit as it is thought that some of the battle was fought at the place now known as Battlefield.

The church was originally a collegiate church, the main duty of the community was to perform a daily liturgy for the dead.  The college and chantry were dissolved in 1548 and the building was used as a parish church.  The building, however, deteriorated and became unused, it has been subject to various restorations.</desc>

<name>Beckbury - St Milburga</name>
<desc>Date: 14th Century AD
Beckbury was included in the Domesday Book and the name means Beocca's Fort or defended place (Beocca being a personal name).

The parish was originally part of the estates of Wenlock Priory from at least 1120 AD and the connection is reflected in the dedication to St Milburga.  In the Middle Ages, Beckbury was a dependent chapelry of the parish of Holy Trinity, Much Wenlock.

The chancel is possibly 14th Century, the nave and the tower were added in 1731.</desc>

<name>Benthall - St Bartholomew</name>
<desc>Date: 1667 AD
At the time of the Domesday Book, the settlement was most likely part of the manor at Much Wenlock.  During the Middle Ages, there was a chapel at Benthall which was dedicated to St Brice, and which was dependent on Wenlock Priory.

The chapel was destroyed in the Civil War and the present church was built to replace it.  The church is considered to be a fine example of a restoration era (the post Civil War Stuart period) church. The church was extended in the late 19th Century.

There is a vertical sun dial on the church with an eye constructed of glass tesserae.

St Bartholomew was the patron saint of bees.  At one time a bee hive was kept in the church, the honey was sold or given away to help the poor of the community.  The bees used to access the hive through the mouth of the lion's head carving which is just beneath the sun dial.

The place-name means 'nook of land where the bent-grass grows', this derives from the Old English 'beonet' whicn means bent-grass and 'halh' (Anglian) which means a nook of land, a small valley, dry ground in marsh, or a piece of land projecting from, or detached from, the main area of its administrative unit.</desc>

Date: 13th Century AD
Bishop's Castle is named from the castle built there by the Bishop of Hereford in circa 1127.

The original church was built towards the end of the 13th century to serve the medieval town controlled by the Bishops of Hereford.  Only the tower remains of the original church (but this was rebuilt in 1648 after the church was badly damaged in 1645 during the Civil War).  The rest of the church was completely re-built in 1869-60 by Thomas Nicholson in the Victorian Gothic style.

During the rebuild, an Early English (1180-1275) doorway was removed and is now in the wall of the vicarage garden.</desc>

The largest church in the area
======
Date: 1845 AD
This church is considered to be the finest early Victorian church in the county, and is constructed throughout in an authentic Perpendicular style.  It is built of stone from Grinshill.

In the late 16th and early 17th Centuries, the wooded parish of Broseley expanded as the coal-mining industry grew, there was further expansion in the 18th Century with increasing industry in the area.  This made the existing church unsuitable for the increasing population.

In the early 1700's, what was probably the original medieval church, was completely rebuilt and finished in 1716.  The present church then replaced this building.  When the new church was consecrated the dedication was changed from St Leonard to All Saints.

The church contains a window by Kempe.

A settlement existed at Broseley in 1086 and is listed as Bosle in the Domesday Book.  The name of the town likely derives from either the Old English for town's guardian (burh-weard) or the Old English personal name Burgweard, and the Old English leah meaning a forest, wood, glade or clearing (and later a pasture or meadow).</desc>

<name>Buildwas - Holy Trinity</name>
<desc>Date: 1720 AD
The name Buildwas may derive its name from the Saxon words 'beild' or 'belde' (a shelter). and 'was' (water), surrounded as it is on three sides by hills and on the fourth by the river Severn.  Another view is that the name is from the Old English 'waesse' which means 'swamp' or 'marsh' and is usually translated as 'land by a meanering river which floods and drains quickly'.

The village of Buildwas has been recognised since 1086 as the first reference to it was made in the Domesday Book.

There has been a church on the present site since medieval times, the present church dates from 1720.  The chancel was rebuilt in 1864, a painting from 1790 shows a shorter western turret with a flatter pyramid top - the present timber-framed belfry probably also dates from 1864.

Within the church are memorial tablets to members of two local families who were closely linked to the Industrial Revolution.  In the churchyard, there are some unusual cast iron headstones and tombstones, which were cast locally.</desc>

The church is known to have existed prior to 1276, as there is one window in the chancel in the present building from before that date.  By the 18th Century, the medieval church was in a poor state of repair and it was replaced by a new building in 1749, the building was significantly remodelled in 1844.

<name>Cardington - St James</name>
<desc>Date: 12th Century AD
The presence of a church on the site is recorded in the Domesday Book.  In 1167, the village, including the church, was given to the Knights Templar (and was known as Templars' Cardington, allowing the people to share the privileges of the Knights).  It remained in their possession until 1308 (when the order was supressed).  The Knights were responsible for starting the building of the present church in the later part of the 12th Century.  During the following century the chancel was rebuilt and extended, and the tower was added.  Further additions and alterations were made during the following three centuries, followed by the porch in 1639.

The body of the church is constructed in sandstone rubble with ashlar dressings and has tiled roofs.  The south doorway contains a door dated 1648.

In the churchyard is a sandstone sundial dating from the middle of the 18th Century.

In the Domesday Book the village is referred to as 'Cardintine under the Fief of Rainwald Vicecomes' and it is mentioned that there were 11 leagues of woodland.  The name 'Cardington' derives from an English chief and warrior named Carda, whose sons and followers were called the Cardinga.  They made their home where the village is, and the village they built became known as Cardington, or the town of the sons of Carda.

In the church is a large monument to Chief Justice of Leighton of Plaish (died 1607), this Jacobean monument is the earliest in Shropshire which depicts the deceased lying on his side. 

Judge Leighton was known as 'the hanging judge' (as was Judge Jeffries) as he condemned so many people to be hanged.  Amongst those condemned by Leighton was a local builder, who had come to the judge to ask to be pardoned for his crime.  The Judge promised him that if he would build him the finest set of chimneys he had ever yet built he would spare his life.  The builder did construct the chimneys (on Plaish Hall).  But after completing the job the Judge ordered the mans' eyes to be put out, and for him to be hanged from the same chimneys he had just built (so that he could build no more chimneys ever finer).  It is said that one can see the rope with which the builder was hanged.</desc>

<desc>Date: 12th Century AD
An Anglo-Saxon church was founded circa 915 when a fort was built on the site.  The current building dates from the 12th Century.  The aisles and arcades were added in the 13th Century - the arcades noticeably lean outwards.  The tower was constructed around 1300 and the chancel was added in 1733.  The church was restored in 1871-72.  The tower and body of the church were constructed using limestone rubble with pink sandstone ashlar dressings and slate roofs.  The chancel is red brick with a tiled roof.

In the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle the place name was recorded as Cyricbyrig.  Later in 1086 in the Domesday book, the place name was recorded as Cireberie which means 'a fortified place with a church'.

The church was reformed into the church of the Augustinian Priory at Chirbury when the order relocated from Snead (near Bishop's Castle) round about 1220.  With the dissolution of the Priory in 1535, the church became a parish church once again.  The church as seen today is the nave of the Priory.</desc>

<name>Church Stretton - St Laurence</name>

The Domesday book makes reference to a church in the Manor existing before the Norman conquest, most likely a small wooden building.

The name Stretton is derived from the old name Stratun which means 'tun' (settlement) near to the 'Street' or Roman Road.

The Norman church was probably built around 1110 to 1130 as the region was growing in prosperity and population (and the Welsh boarder was quieter).

The church was extended in circa 1214 AD - a new chancel, transcepts in the form of a cruciform and the lower tower were constructed.  A century or so later, the windows were enlarged and the tower was extended.</desc>

Date: 12th Century AD
The church can trace its origins back to the 7th Century (Saxon), however, the present church dates from the 12th Century.

Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, held the manor and the church was connected with the collegiate foundation which he endowed at Quatford.

The church was added to in the 13th and 15th Centuries - the tower was doubled in height and angle buttresses were added to it towards the end of the 15th century.  At about the same time the north chapel was added.

The church is noted for the medieval wall paintings which have been dated to circa 1200.

======
Date: 13th Century AD
The church is dedicated to St Peter because of its medieval association with Shrewsbury Abbey, which is dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul.

The oldest part of the church is the nave which dates from the 13th Century, and although the south aisle was built at the same time as the nave it was rebuilt a century later.  Since then the church has been added to quite considerably.  The tower was added in the 15th Century and in 1841/1842 the north aisle was built.  In 1862 the chancel was built and in 1889-91 the vestry was added re-using the 13th-century priest's door.

The church is constructed in red and yellow sandstone.  In the older parts of the building the colours are used randomly, and for the 19th Century additions the blocks are deliberately arranged.

The interior has many features of interest including the font which dates from the 12th Century (Norman) and the Pulpit which is dates 1633 (Jacobean).  In the chancel are re-used medieval tiles.  Over the chancel arch is part of a 15th Century wall painting of the Last Judgement.  There are many monuments on the interior walls.  In the churchyard is a sandstone cross base dating from the 18th Century or earlier.

The name of the village is taken from the nearby brook, Cound Brook.  In the Domesday book, the manor was recorded as Cuneet.</desc>

The name Cressage means 'Christ's Oak', and so it is thought the village's location may be a very early Christian site (possibly an oak tree from where the gospel was preached).

There was a medieval church at Cressage, but it suffered repeated flooding from the nearby river Severn and so the current church was built on higher ground.  The rather austere church was architected by Edward Haycock snr (Haycock was responsible for 14 churches in Shropshire, other work by him includes Millichope Park and the Lord Hill monument in Shrewsbury).

The octagonal pulpit is made of panelling from St Samson's church (the old medieval church).</desc>

Norman nave believed to date from 1140 to 1150, tower and chancel Victorian

Contains a monument to Lord Rowland Hill - he is buried in a sealed crypt beneath the tower
======
Date: 1140 to 1150 AD
The church was originally a chapel of ease (a church built within the bounds of a parish for those who could not easily attend the parish church), the Norman nave is thought to date from 1140 to 1150.  It is thought that the nave may have been rebuilt in the 14th Century.  The tower was added in the 1830s and the chancel was built in 1874.

General Sir Rowland Hill (died in 1842), who was Wellington's second in command at the Battle of Waterloo is buried in a sealed crypt beneath the tower and there is a monument to him in the church.

The name of the village is derived from the Old English meaning 'Headda's nook of land' ('halh' is a nook of land or a piece of land detached from the main area of its administrative unit).</desc>

The present church was build in 1863 to replace a chapel (dating from 1759).  The church was designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield and is considered to be the best of the four Shropshire churches he designed.  Blomfield was a prolific architect, and a leading figure in his profession.

The church has an unusual bell-turret, the style is French Gothic which was in vogue in the 1860s.  The church is most noted for its tiles - there are both Maws and Craven Dunhill tiles in the building.</desc>

======
Date: 14th Century AD
In 1313 the lords of the manor at Langley (the Burnell's of Actor Burnell) obtained permission to build a chapel at Langley.  The structure of the present building dates from this time.  The chapel was fitted out in about 1546 by the Lee family (to whom the manor of Langley had passed in the second half of the 14th Century).  The chapel was re-roofed in 1601 by the same family.

By the start of the 18th Century, the chapel had largely fallen out of use, and so avoided the changes being made to churches to re-order interiors to the more elaborate 'high church' model favoured in the 19th Century.  Consequently, it is the set of early 17th Century fittings that makes this chapel significant.

The last regular service was held at Langley Chapel in 1871.

The name of the settlement derives from the Old English meaning long wood/clearing - lang (long or tall) and leah (a forest, wood, glade or clearing, and later a pasture or meadow).</desc>

Date: 1847-1853 AD
The present church was the result of rebuilding the old medieval church in stages between 1847 and 1853 by the then vicar.  The almost detached steeple was designed and added in 1855-6 by the same vicar, he was convinced that the shape would be stronger than the usual hollow spire construction where the thickness of the straight sides diminishes towards the apex.  The height is 104 ft (tower 57 ft and spire 47 ft).

The place name means 'an enclosure (especially a church or churchyard) by a spring or well which is red (this may refer to a red-leaved tree or red soil)'.</desc>

======
Date: 1275 AD
Since its construction, the building has hardly been altered.  The western bell turret is 19th Century.

The interior is noted for its wooden furnishings, some of which date from the 17th Century.

The building is considered to be a perfect example of Early English architecture, it is considered to be a rarity among English parish churches as the building is entirely a single medieval style.

The church may even date back to before the 12th Century.  It is thought to be unique not just within Shropshire, but in the whole of England, in that it has not been the subject of Victorian restoration or alteration.  It is a simple and plain country church.

The church has two bells, one is 15th Century, and the other is from 1150, making it one of the oldest bells listed in the National Bell Register.

Some of the roof timbers have been identified as being from trees felled between 1225 and 1250, which makes them some of the oldest in situ church roof timbers.  The original roof was replaced after about 100 years, the timbers in the replacement roof are from trees felled between 1326 and 1348.

<desc>Date: 1869 AD
After the civil war the villagers of Newtown and other nearby villages desired to have a chapel of ease as the parish church of Wem was too far away.  Initially a private house was used which was consecrated after the Restoration in 1665.  In 1836 this building was demolished and replaced with a brick church.  In 1861 the parish was formed and in 1869 the brick church was replaced with the present stone church.

The church has an unusual Carillon of 6 bells.

The pulpit is marble and dates from 1898.

The elegant wrought-iron screen dates from circa 1870.

The name of the village simply equates to the Old English new (niwe) and enclosure, farmstead or village (tun).</desc>

Date: 13th Century
The original church was built circa 1200, the tower dates from the late 13th Century / early 14th Century.  The church was substantially rebuilt from 1879 to 1893 (nave 1879-80, chancel 1892-3 and spire 1880).

The tower has a very distinctive batter (a receding or inward slope) and very thick walls - indicating a degree of defensibility.

Until 1894 Norbury was a dependent chapelry of Lydbury North.  Also, records from 1521 indicate that the church was dedicated to St Ethelbert.

The yew tree in the churchyard is believed to be circa 2,700 years old, the tree has a girth of approx. 33ft.

The name of the village derives from the Old English for northern (nord) and fortified place (burh).  There are hill fort defences near the church.</desc>

In 642 AD Oswald, the King of Northumbria who had previously converted to Christianity was killed by the pagan King Penda of Mercia in the Battle of Oswestry, as a result he rose to martyrdom.  He is thought to have been killed on the site of the church.

The present church was built in the 13th Century.  Only the lower parts of the tower remain from the original building as the church was heavily damaged in the Civil War (having been used as a lookout tower).  The church was rebuilt in the 17th Century and further restored in the 19th Century.  Most of the windows are Victorian.

The church was originally built as a chapel of ease in the 12th Century, but later became a parish church. The date of the change to church is unknown, but is likely some time in the 14th or 15th Century.

In 1866 part of the medieval church was demolished, just the chancel was retained which became the south aisle of a new church.

The Victorian church was pulled down in 1973, leaving the medieval chancel as the church once again.  The 19th Century arcade was blocked, and now forms the north wall of the remaining building.  A bell from Preston Gubbals is now installed in St Alkmund's Church in Shrewsbury, the bell was cast 1720.

The sundial in the churchyard was originally a churchyard cross, dated 1638.

The name of the village in Old English means 'Priests' farm/settlement (tun)'.  It was held in 1086 by a priest name Godebold who was a tenant of St. Alkmund's church in Shrewsbury, the name was corrupted to Gubbals.</desc>

Date: 1291 AD
The village is close to Offa's Dyke and the dyke bounds the parish on the west, the name derives from sulh and tun which means in Old English a plough(-land) farm/settlement, or perhaps, a gully farm/settlement and has also been modified by Welsh influence.

The churchyard has a number of very old yew trees, suggesting that the site has been a place of Christian worship for over 1000 years.  However, the church itself is first mentioned in the Papal Tax records in 1291.  The church is noted for its 13th Century font and the barrel roof over the chancel, which is thought to be from the 14th Century.  The north and south transepts were added in 1821-28.

St Alkmund died circa 802 AD, he was the younger son of Alhred (king of Northumbria) at Lilleshall, his relics were removed to the collegiate church dedicated to him at Derby.  This church in Shrewsbury was also founded as a collegiate church in 912 AD by Aethelflaed, daughter of Alfred the Great, king of Mercia.  By the time of the Domesday survey, the church was substantially endowed.  However, when Lilleshall Abbey was established in 1148 AD, the church became an poor vicarage as property was transferred to Lilleshall.

The church stands at the highest point in the town.

The original medieval church is thought to have been a very fine example.  However, following the collapse of Old St Chad's in 1788, there was concern about the safety of the church.  An act of Parliament decreed the demolition and rebuilding of all but the tower.

The present tower and spire were built around 1475 AD.  The rest of the present church is Georgian.</desc>

Stapleton is an ancient manor recorded in the Domesday book as Hundeslit (from the personal name Hund and the Old English for hill-side.  The present name is derived from steep-place farm/settlement (stepel and tun).

The present church was built in the 12th Century and for reasons unknown it was originally a two storey building, a possibly unique feature amongst churches.  The second storey was built on top of the very thick walls of a Saxon or Early Norman church.  The church was on the upper floor and the ground floor is assumed to have been an undercroft.

The tower was added in 1832, it is unknown when the two storey were converted into one - the result is a tall church with two tiers of windows.

The church organ is among the top six hundred in the country and there is a small tapestry piece in the nave said to have been worked by Mary, Queen of Scots.

Date: 1410 AD
Sometimes referred to as the 'Westminster Abbey of the Midlands'; the church is noted for its architecture which includes a fan vaulted side chapel (which is rare in Shropshire) and its numerous tombs.

The church was founded by the widowed Isabel Lingen as a chantry and collegiate church.  The commission to dissolve the college was issued on 17th September 1546 and referred to the legislation that permitted the king's commissioners to seize property on his behalf.

The church is a cruciform building (rare for the Perpendicular era) and is built of red sandstone (which is abundant locally).  The church is noted for its bourdon bell which weighs over 2 tonnes and is called the Great Bell of Tong - claimed to be the loudest and biggest bell in Shropshire.  It had been feared that the tower would not support continued tolling, so it is rung only on certain days / occasions which gives the vicar of the church an equal status with the local noble families and the sitting monarch.

The name Tong is derived from the old English 'tweonga' meaning a pinched piece or a spit of land, in this case, it describes the situation of the village between the two headstreams of the River Worfe.</desc>

The nave and chancel are originally Norman, as is the south doorway of the Nave.  Some original masonry survives in the chancel but the church was substantially rebuilt and enriched by the architect G E Street (best known as the designer of the Royal Courts of Justice) in the 1850s and 1860s.  The tower is Perpendicular (he final phase of Gothic architecture, which spanned the late 14th Century to the early 16th Century).

The present church was built to replace a medieval one which was damaged during the Civil War.  The church was designed by George Steuart who was also responsible for St Chad's in Shrewsbury - All Saints being built a little earlier and is less impressive than St Chad's.  No extensions have been added, but the interior has been modified on a number of occasions.

This was the first Shropshire church to introduce an entrance front in the form of a monumental classical temple portico.  The building is made of Grinshill stone with a slate roof.

There is mention of a priest at the site in the Domesday book.  The origin of the name of the town is uncertain, but is likely to mean farm or settlement of a Saxon settler - Weola.</desc>

<desc>Date: 1860s AD
The present church was preceeded by a Saxon or Norman church, a medieval building dating from 1391 and church built in 1788 which became inadequate for the needs of the parish and fell into disrepair.  In 1861 a new building was commissioned from the leading architect of the day Sir George Gilbert Scott.  The walls are of yellow sandstone ashlar; the church has a slate roof which has a lozenge pattern over the nave and a zig-zag pattern over the chancel.

Welshampton is recorded in the Domesday book as Hantone, meaning high farm or settlement.  The prefix 'Welsh' is a reflection of its proximity to Flintshire.

An African prince is buried in the churchyard - the then vicar was as offered a post in Lesotho, which he turned down but maintained contact with the country.  The prince came to England to train as a priest and visited Welshampton when the new church was consecrated in 1863, but during the visit he caught a fever and died and so was buried at the church.</desc>

The 'hurricane tombstone' commemorates a ferrocious blizzard which wiped out an entire family

The tragic tale of a family who died when their house was swept away in a hurricane is commemorated in the hilltop church at Wentnor, between the Long Mynd and the Stiperstones. The story of Samuel Pirkins, his wife Mary and son Samuel is recorded on the so-called Hurricane Tombstone, which is tucked away in a quiet corner. The family were killed when a 'hurricane of wind and snow' struck the nearby hamlet of Asterton in 1772. 
======
Date: Norman (1095 AD or earlier)
The original church was Norman and there are a few surviving elements of this church in the present building.  The advowson (the right of presentation of a candidate to a benefice or church office) of the church was presented to the Abbey of Shrewsbury as early as 1095.  Much of the church was rebuilt in 1886.

The church has a notable tombstone (the so called Hurricane Tombstone) inside by the font under the tower, it commemorates a hurricane and snow storm which claimed the lives of seven villagers from the nearby hamlet of Asterton in 1772.

In the Domesday book, Wentnor is listed as Wantenovre.  The name of the village means Wonta's or Wenta's (personal name) flat-topped ridge (Old English ofer).</desc>

The medieval chancel was pulled down in 1753 and rebuilt.  The tower was also rebuilt at this time as the previous tower collapsed in 1753.  The church is noted for its roof structure in the aisle and nave, said to be the oldest roof of its type in the country, dendrochronolgy dates the timbers to 1342.  It is the trussed rafters and the collar-beams on the arched braces that make this roof special.  A grant from English Heritage has paid for substantial repairs.

The name of the village derives from the Old English west and burh meaning a fortified place, i.e. a fortified place in the west.  It was an outpost of Wroxeter Roman City, also close to Caus Castle which was a border stronghold.</desc>

Date: 1712 AD
Whitchurch is the oldest continually inhabited town in Shropshire.

Whitchurch acquired its present name after the construction of a Norman church in white Grinshill stone (replacing a wooden Saxon church), from the Middle English for 'White Church'.  Originally a Roman settlement it was half way between Wroxeter and Chester and so was known as Mediolanum (the place in the middle of the plain).  In the Doomsday book it was known as Westune (indicating its situation on the Western border of England).

The Norman church was extended in medieval times, but collaspsed on Sunday 31st July 1711.

The present church was built on the same site, this time of red sandstone.</desc>

Whittington was once a place of some importance.  The Welsh form of the place name is Drefwen, which means white homestead.  The English form of the name, Wittone, also means white homestead.</desc>
