      A mini sheet featuring Sebastian Vettel.
      
      Vettel started his F1 as a test driver for BMW Sauber and made his debut with the team at the 2007 USA Grand Prix replacing the injured Robert Kubica.  Later that season he joined Toro Rosso.
      
      Vettel was quickly promoted to the Red Bull team in 2009 and finished that season as the youngest-ever World Drivers' Championship runner-up.  The following year he went on to become the youngest driver ever to win the World Drivers' Championship, aged 23.  This was then followed immediately with the same accolade for a double, triple and quadruple World Drivers' Champion.
      
      Ending a long-term association with Red Bull, Vettel activated a clause to end his contract with Red Bull after the 2014 season and moved to Ferrari.
