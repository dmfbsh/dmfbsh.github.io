      A mini sheet featuring the 2010 Malaysion Grand Prix.
      
      The race was won by Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) followed by Mark Weber in the other Red Bull, Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) was third.  The race will be remembered for the storms during Qualifying which mixed up the grid, the result was some great charges from drivers who would normally be at the front on race day.  Ross Brawn believed the mix up to be too much reliance on weather radars and not enough common sense being applied to the conditions - the main casualties of this were the Ferraris and the McLarens.
