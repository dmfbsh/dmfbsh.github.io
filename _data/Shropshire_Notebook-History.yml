  Date: c. 2500 BC to 800 BC - Bronze Age
  Description: |
    Remains of Bronze Age settlements are not common in Britain and none have been recorded in Shropshire so far.  It is believed that many tribes led a nomadic lifestyle based on cattle and agriculture so did not build to last.  There is evidence of tree clearing at this time to make space for crops; and, communities were often based near rivers for transport.

    Tumuli (burial mounds) were built during this time on areas of high ground.  As well as providing a place to inter the cremated remains of their dead, the tumuli may also be where a tribe gathered at certain times of the year for religious purposes.  The stone circles at Mitchell's Fold, Hoarstones and Whetstones (now destroyed) date from this time.

  Date: c. 800 BC to the Roman invasion of Britain in 43 AD - Iron Age
  Description: |
    c. 500 BC - Celts inhabit much of Europe, and begin to colonize the British Isles.

    The area now known as Shropshire was part of the territory of the Celtic Cornovii tribe (they also occupied the areas now known as Cheshire, Staffordshire north Herefordshire and parts of the eastern areas of Wales - areas now known Flintshire, Powys and Wrexham).

    The capital of the tribe was most probably the Wrekin hill fort.  The first mention of the tribe occurs in the works of Ptolemy in the 2nd Century AD.  The origin of the name is unknown, but it may mean 'People of the Horn' referring to a horned god cult followed by the tribe.

  Name: Old Oswestry Hill Fort
  Description: |
    One of Britain's most spectacular and impressive early Iron Age hill forts.

    The complexity of the defences suggests several phases of development.  After the hill fort was abandoned it was incorporated into Wat's Dyke (built by the king of Mercia in the early 8th Century, it preceded the better-known Offa's Dyke).

  Description: |
    The site was first established in about AD 55 as a frontier post as it was strategically located near the end of the primary Watling Street Roman trunk road which ran across England from Dubris (Dover).

    The site was abandoned around 88 AD as a fortress and was taken over as a civilian settlement.

    The ruin is noted for the 'the Old Work' (an archway, part of the baths' frigidarium and the largest free-standing Roman ruin in Britain).

    Anglo-Saxon settlement (Angles, Frisians, Saxons, Jutes) of Britain begins.

    Following the collapse of the Romano-British administration, the Cornovii territory may have become part of the Kingdom of Powys, but little is known about this period in respect of the area now known as Shropshire.

    The boarder country between England and Wales was much fought over - the Kingdom of Powys and Anglian-Mercia both vying for territory.  It is possible that Shrewsbury was established at this time due to the king of Powys moving court to resist the encroaching Anglian advances.

    It is likely that the Cornovii territory was partitioned and ruled by different princes, probably perpetuated in the ancient boundaries between the dioceses of Lichfield and Hereford.

    Eventually, the northern part of Shropshire was part of the Anglo-Saxon territory of Wreocensaete (sometimes anglicised to Wrekinsets, the name approximates to Wrekin-dwellers) and the southern part of Shropshire probably belonged to the Magonsaete (a minor sub-kingdom of the greater Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia).

    The northern and southern parts of Shropshire were absorbed into the Saxon kingdom of Mercia by King Offa (Offa ruled Mercia from 757 to 796).

    The original Anglo-Saxon monastery was founded by the then King of Magonsaete (king Merewalh), his daughter quickly became its abbess (she was later canonised).

    After Milburga's death circa 727 little is known of the monastery until the Norman conquest.  Wenlock was re-founded by the Normans as a priory of Cluniac monks in the late 11th Century by Roger de Montgomery. In 1101 it is reputed that Milburga's relics were discovered, attracting pilgrims and prosperity to the the priory allowing the impressive medieval priory to be built (which reflects the Cluniac love of elaborate decoration).

  Date: 1066 AD
  Description: |
    The Norman conquest of Britain and start of Early Middle Ages (Medieval England).

    After the Norman Conquest the principal estates of Shropshire were all bestowed on Norman proprietors, pre-eminent among whom is Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury.

    Many churches are built in the 11th and 12th Centuries - the church was massively endowed and its role all pervasive in medieval society.

    Many new towns are established in the period from the Norman Conquest to the mid-13th Century and are a result of deliberate plantation.

    During the 12th Century the Marcher lordships emerged as almost independent states between the Welsh and English authorities.  The Marcher families were granted privileges by the English Crown which led to the exclusion of the judicial authority of the monarch and the Sheriff from their domains.

  Name: Ludlow Castle
  Description: |
    The castle is believed to have been founded by Walter de Lacy after the Norman Conquest and was one of the first stone castles to be built in England.

    During the 12th and 13th Centuries the castle changed hands many times.  The Duke of York inherited the castle in 1425 and it was a symbol of Yorkist authority during the Wars of the Roses.  Then in 1461 ownership passed to the crown.

    The castle was chosen as the seat of the Council in the Marches of Wales and so was effectively the capital of Wales.  Consequently, the castle was renovated throughout the 16th Century.

    With the castle being besieged and taken by Parliamentary forces during the English Civil War and following the abolition of the Council in 1689 (after it had been restored following the English Civil War), the castle fell into neglect.

  Name: Oswestry Castle
  Description: |
    The first reference to this castle is in 1086 - the recording of castelle Lurve in the Domesday book as being built by the then Sheriff of Shropshire in the Hundred of Meresberie.

    No town was recorded until 1272, although the Welsh were referring to Croes Oswald in 1254.

    The castle was fought over and changed ownership many times during the conflict between the English and the Welsh.  By 1270 the castle's walls had been extended to encircle the town, but by this time the castle's military significance was in decline.

    The castle was the scene of a parliament held by Richard II in 1398.

    The castle was captured by Oliver Cromwell's troops in 1644, and by 1650 it had largely been demolished by the Roundheads.

  Name: Bridgnorth Castle
  Description: |
    Founded in 1101 by Robert de Belleme (the second Earl of Shrewsbury, succeeding after his father Roger de Montgomery).

    The main feature of the castle is the great square tower, built during the reign of Henry II.

    During the English Civil War, Bridgnorth was one of the Midlands' main Royalist strongholds.  But following a three week siege Cromwell's Roundheads took Bridgnorth - Cromwell ordered that the castle be demolished and by 1647 little of the structure remained.  As a result, the remaining parts of the great tower now lean at an angle of 15 degrees (four times the lean of the tower at Pisa).

    Nothing remains of the original 11th Century church, but 100 years later a second church was built in a style of mixed Norman and early-English.  It is thought that a barrow was removed in 1199 to enlarge the churchyard.

    There was a massive rebuilding of the church between 1433 and 1471, much of which was paid for by the wealthy Palmers' Guild, which endowed a number of chantries in the church.

  Name: Hopton Castle
  Description: |
    It is believed that the castle was founded in the 12th century as a motte and bailey castle by one of the de Optons as a mesne lord of the Says of Clun Castle.  The family was politically significant, Sir Walter de Opton being Sheriff of the large, adjacent counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire.

    It is most probable that Walter de Opton (over time becoming de Hopton) built the stone castle during the Barons' War of the 1260s.  The bailey was fortified in stone and the rectangular two-storey keep was built.

    The last Walter Hopton died during the Wars of the Roses in the 15th century and the castle passed by marriage to the Corbet family of Moreton Corbet castle.

A benefit only extended to trusted people, Burnell as a friend and advisor to King Edward I, was granted a royal licence to crenellate and fortify the manor.

    In the Autumn of 1283, it is believed that Edward I held a Parliament at Acton Burnell - this is significant because it was the first time in English history that the law making process included the Commons.  The law passed became known as the Statute of Acton Burnell, a law giving protection to creditors, indicating the increasing significance of traders during those times.

  Name: Stokesay Castle
  Description: |
    One of the first fortified manor houses in England, Stokesay Castle was built by Laurence of Ludlow.  It was built on the site of an earlier castle, some of which still survives.  Laurence of Ludlow was one of the leading wool merchants in England.

    The gatehouse was added in 1640-1641, just before the English Civil War.  At that time Stokesay was owned by William Craven, the first Earl of Craven and supporter of the king.  The Royalist war effort collapsed in 1645, the castle was besieged and the Royalist garrison was forced to surrender.  The castle was ordered to be slighted by Parliament, but only minor damage was done allowing it to continue as a residence.

  Name: St Bartholomew, Tong
  Description: |
    Sometimes referred to as the 'Westminster Abbey of the Midlands'; the church is noted for its architecture which includes a fan vaulted side chapel (which is rare in Shropshire) and its numerous tombs.

    The church was founded by the widowed Isabel Lingen as a chantry and collegiate church.  The commission to dissolve the college was issued on 17th September 1546 and referred to the legislation that permitted the king's commissioners to seize property on his behalf.

    The church is a cruciform building (rare for the Perpendicular era) and is built of red sandstone (which is abundant locally).  The church is noted for its bourdon bell which weighs over 2 tonnes and is called the Great Bell of Tong - claimed to be the loudest and biggest bell in Shropshire.  It had been feared that the tower would not support continued tolling, so it is rung only on certain days / occasions which gives the vicar of the church an equal status with the local noble families and the sitting monarch.

  Name: Lavington's Hole, Bridgnorth
  Description: |
    On 31st March 1646 during the Civil War, Bridgnorth was under siege from Parliamentary forces - the Royalists retreated to the castle after setting fire to the stables in Listley Street.  The fire soon spread to burn down many buildings in High Town.  It was the incendiary torches fired from the castle that ignited St. Leonards Church, burning all the town records that were stored in the church.  By 1st April 1646 most of Bridgnorth High Town was destroyed by the great fire.

    After three weeks of continued attack on the castle Colonel Lavington took charge of getting a team of Parliamentary forces to dig a 70 foot tunnel under Castle Hill.  Knowing that the Royalists stored their gunpowder in St Marys Church, his aim was to blow up the church.

    69 feet of tunnel was dug into the rock face but was not completed as the Royalists surrendered on Sunday 26th April 1646.

    The name The Dana is still often used for the prison - the Dana Gaol was a medieval prison close to the site of the current establishment.

    The bust of prison reformer John Howard is above the main entrance to the prison (Howard consulted on the construction of the prison).

    The prison is famous for the high number of hangings that took place on its grounds - these took place from 1795 (the crime - theft of 10 handkerchiefs) to 1961 (the crime - robbery and murder).

  Name: William Penny Brookes Born
  Description: |
    William Penny Brookes was an English surgeon, magistrate, botanist, and educationalist.  He established the Olympian Class of his Wenlock Agricultural Reading Society in 1850 to inspire local people to keep fit and take part in sports competitions.  Following the 1860 games, the Olympian Class was set up as the independent Wenlock Olympian Society.

    Brookes' campaign for physical education brought him into contact with Baron Pierre de Coubertin - in 1890, the young French aristocrat visited Much Wenlock and stayed with Dr Brookes at his lifelong home in Wilmore Street.  Coubertin was inspired by discussions with Brookes and a games staged for his visit - in 1894 Coubertin set up the International Olympic Committee.

    Consequently, Dr Brookes is credited as a founding father of the modern Olympic Games, and one of the Olympic mascots for London 2012 was named Wenlock after the town.

  Name: St Michael and All Angels, Welshampton
  Description: |
    The present church was preceeded by a Saxon or Norman church, a medieval building dating from 1391 and church built in 1788 which became inadequate for the needs of the parish and fell into disrepair.  In 1861 a new building was commissioned from the leading architect of the day Sir George Gilbert Scott.  The walls are of yellow sandstone ashlar; the church has a slate roof which has a lozenge pattern over the nave and a zig-zag pattern over the chancel.

    Welshampton is recorded in the Domesday book as Hantone, meaning high settlement.

    An African prince is buried in the churchyard - the then vicar was as offered a post in Lesotho, which he turned down but maintained contact with the country.  The prince came to England to train as a priest and visited Welshampton when the new church was consecrated in 1863, but during the visit he caught a fever and died and so was buried at the church.
