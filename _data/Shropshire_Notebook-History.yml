  Date: c. 2500 BC to 800 BC - Bronze Age
  Description: |
    Remains of Bronze Age settlements are not common in Britain and none have been recorded in Shropshire so far.  It is believed that many tribes led a nomadic lifestyle based on cattle and agriculture so did not build structures to last (communities were often based near rivers for transport).  There is evidence, however, of tree clearing at this time to make space for crops.

    Tumuli (burial mounds) were built during this time on areas of high ground.  As well as providing a place to inter the cremated remains of their dead, the tumuli may also be where a tribe gathered at certain times of the year for religious purposes.  The stone circles at Mitchell's Fold, Hoarstones and Whetstones (now destroyed) date from this time.

  Date: c. 800 BC to the Roman invasion of Britain in 43 AD - Iron Age
  Description: |
    c. 500 BC - Celts inhabit much of Europe, and begin to colonize the British Isles.

    The area now known as Shropshire was part of the territory of the Celtic Cornovii tribe (they also occupied the areas now known as Cheshire, Staffordshire north Herefordshire and parts of the eastern areas of Wales - areas now known Flintshire, Powys and Wrexham).

    The capital of the tribe was most probably the Wrekin hill fort.  The first mention of the tribe occurs in the works of Ptolemy in the 2nd Century AD.  The origin of the name Cornovii is unknown, but it may mean 'People of the Horn' referring to a horned god cult followed by the tribe.

  Description: |
    One of Britain's most spectacular and impressive early Iron Age hill forts.

    The complexity of the defences suggests several phases of development.  After the hill fort was abandoned it was incorporated into Wat's Dyke (built by the king of Mercia in the early 8th Century, it preceded the better-known Offa's Dyke).

  Description: |
    The site was first established in about AD 55 as a frontier post as it was strategically located near the end of the primary Watling Street Roman trunk road which ran across England from Dubris (Dover).

    The site was abandoned around 88 AD as a fortress and was taken over as a civilian settlement.

    The ruin is noted for the 'the Old Work' (an archway, part of the baths' frigidarium and the largest free-standing Roman ruin in Britain).

    Anglo-Saxon settlement (Angles, Frisians, Saxons, Jutes) of Britain begins.

    Following the collapse of the Romano-British administration, the Cornovii territory may have become part of the Kingdom of Powys, but little is known about this period in respect of the area now known as Shropshire.

    The boarder country between England and Wales was much fought over - the Kingdom of Powys and Anglian-Mercia both vying for territory.  It is possible that Shrewsbury was established at this time due to the king of Powys moving court to resist the encroaching Anglian advances.

    It is likely that the Cornovii territory was partitioned and ruled by different princes, probably perpetuated in the ancient boundaries between the dioceses of Lichfield and Hereford.

    Eventually, the northern part of Shropshire was part of the Anglo-Saxon territory of Wreocensaete (sometimes anglicised to Wrekinsets, the name approximates to Wrekin-dwellers) and the southern part of Shropshire probably belonged to the Magonsaete (a minor sub-kingdom of the greater Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia).

    The northern and southern parts of Shropshire were absorbed into the Saxon kingdom of Mercia by King Offa (Offa ruled Mercia from 757 to 796).

  Name: Ludlow Castle
  Description: |
    The castle is believed to have been founded by Walter de Lacy after the Norman Conquest and was one of the first stone castles to be built in England.

    During the 12th and 13th Centuries the castle changed hands many times.  The Duke of York inherited the castle in 1425 and it was a symbol of Yorkist authority during the Wars of the Roses.  Then in 1461 ownership passed to the crown.

    The castle was chosen as the seat of the Council in the Marches of Wales and so was effectively the capital of Wales.  Consequently, the castle was renovated throughout the 16th Century.

    With the castle being besieged and taken by Parliamentary forces during the English Civil War and following the abolition of the Council in 1689 (after it had been restored following the English Civil War), the castle fell into neglect.

    Also known as the abbey church of St Peter and St Paul.

    The abbey was one of the last to surrender (being at the end of the commissioners circuit) and was dissolved on 24th January 1540.

  Name: Oswestry Castle
  Description: |
    The first reference to this castle is in 1086 - the recording of castelle Lurve in the Domesday book as being built by the then Sheriff of Shropshire in the Hundred of Meresberie.

    No town was recorded until 1272, although the Welsh were referring to Croes Oswald in 1254.

    The castle was fought over and changed ownership many times during the conflict between the English and the Welsh.  By 1270 the castle's walls had been extended to encircle the town, but by this time the castle's military significance was in decline.

    The castle was the scene of a parliament held by Richard II in 1398.

    The castle was captured by Oliver Cromwell's troops in 1644, and by 1650 it had largely been demolished by the Roundheads.

  Description: |
    Founded in 1101 by Robert de Belleme (the second Earl of Shrewsbury, succeeding after his father Roger de Montgomery).

    The main feature of the castle is the great square tower, built during the reign of Henry II.

    During the English Civil War, Bridgnorth was one of the Midlands' main Royalist strongholds.  But following a three week siege Cromwell's Roundheads took Bridgnorth - Cromwell ordered that the castle be demolished and by 1647 little of the structure remained.  As a result, the remaining parts of the great tower now lean at an angle of 15 degrees (four times the lean of the tower at Pisa).

  Name: Lilleshall Abbey
  Description: |
    The Abbey was founded around 1148 AD for a community of what is thought to be about 13 Augustinian canons from Dorchester Abbey in Oxfordshire.

    During the 13th Century, the Abbey enjoyed great wealth and prestige - a respectable income was derived from a variety of sources, including even the tolls for the use of the Atcham Bridge.  The then king (Henry III) was entertained at the Abbey twice in about 1240 AD.

    The Abbey suffered financial problems in the 14th Century (the abbott was accused of mismanagement).

    The Abbey was closed in 1538, as part of the Suppression of the Monasteries.  The site then became a private dwelling until the mid-17th Century.

    During the Civil War, the former Abbey buildings were severely damaged by Parliamentarian troops, at which point the site was abandoned and left to decay.

  Description: |
    Haughmond was an Augustinian monastery and was closely associated with the FitzAlan family (who became Earls of Arundel).

    It was a successful and wealthy abbey.

    The commission to dissolve the abbey was issued from Woodstock Palace on 23 August 1539 and signed by Thomas Cromwell.  A deed of surrender was drawn up on 19 September.  By 16 October, the abbot, the prior and 9 canons had signed to acknowledge Henry VIII as supreme over the Church of England.

    The site was sold, some buildings were used as a private residence, others were plundered for building stone.  During the Civil War, fire further destroyed the site and it was turned over for use as a farm.

  Name: Hopton Castle
  Description: |
    It is believed that the castle was founded in the 12th century as a motte and bailey castle by one of the de Optons as a mesne lord of the Says of Clun Castle.  The family was politically significant, Sir Walter de Opton being Sheriff of the large, adjacent counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire.

    It is most probable that Walter de Opton (over time becoming de Hopton) built the stone castle during the Barons' War of the 1260s.  The bailey was fortified in stone and the rectangular two-storey keep was built.

    The last Walter Hopton died during the Wars of the Roses in the 15th century and the castle passed by marriage to the Corbet family of Moreton Corbet castle.

A benefit only extended to trusted people, Burnell as a friend and advisor to King Edward I, was granted a royal licence to crenellate and fortify the manor.

    In the Autumn of 1283, it is believed that Edward I held a Parliament at Acton Burnell - this is significant because it was the first time in English history that the law making process included the Commons.  The law passed became known as the Statute of Acton Burnell, a law giving protection to creditors, indicating the increasing significance of traders during those times.

  Description: |
    One of the first fortified manor houses in England, Stokesay Castle was built by Laurence of Ludlow.  It was built on the site of an earlier castle, some of which still survives.  Laurence of Ludlow was one of the leading wool merchants in England.

    The gatehouse was added in 1640-1641, just before the English Civil War.  At that time Stokesay was owned by William Craven, the first Earl of Craven and supporter of the king.  The Royalist war effort collapsed in 1645, the castle was besieged and the Royalist garrison was forced to surrender.  The castle was ordered to be slighted by Parliament, but only minor damage was done allowing it to continue as a residence.

  Name: The Feathers, Ludlow
  Description: |
    Built by Rees Jones, a successful attorney in the town, who had frequently appeared before the Council of the Marches, which from 1536 until 1689 was situated in Ludlow, making the town in effect the capital of Wales.

    The facade is decorated with Ostrich feathers which represented the Royalist support of the town for the Prince of Wales (who later became Charles I).  During the English Civil War the town remained loyal to the King and it is thought that Royalist Soldiers lodged at The Feathers during this time.

  Name: Lavington's Hole, Bridgnorth
  Description: |
    On 31st March 1646 during the Civil War, Bridgnorth was under siege from Parliamentary forces - the Royalists retreated to the castle after setting fire to the stables in Listley Street.  The fire soon spread to burn down many buildings in High Town.  It was the incendiary torches fired from the castle that ignited St. Leonards Church, burning all the town records that were stored in the church.  By 1st April 1646 most of Bridgnorth High Town was destroyed by the great fire.

    After three weeks of continued attack on the castle Colonel Lavington took charge of getting a team of Parliamentary forces to dig a 70 foot tunnel under Castle Hill.  Knowing that the Royalists stored their gunpowder in St Marys Church, his aim was to blow up the church.

    69 feet of tunnel was dug into the rock face but was not completed as the Royalists surrendered on Sunday 26th April 1646.

  Name: Pitchford Treehouse
  Description: |
    The treehouse is thought to be the oldest in the world, it is of circa 17th Century origin (first mentioned in 1692). It was given a new image in 1760 and was renovated again in 1980.

    The bust of prison reformer John Howard is above the main entrance to the prison (Howard consulted on the construction of the prison).

    The prison is famous for the high number of hangings that took place on its grounds - these took place from 1795 (the crime - theft of 10 handkerchiefs) to 1961 (the crime - robbery and murder).

  Description: |
    William Penny Brookes was an English surgeon, magistrate, botanist, and educationalist.  He established the Olympian Class of his Wenlock Agricultural Reading Society in 1850 to inspire local people to keep fit and take part in sports competitions.  Following the 1860 games, the Olympian Class was set up as the independent Wenlock Olympian Society.

    Brookes' campaign for physical education brought him into contact with Baron Pierre de Coubertin - in 1890, the young French aristocrat visited Much Wenlock and stayed with Dr Brookes at his lifelong home in Wilmore Street.  Coubertin was inspired by discussions with Brookes and a games staged for his visit - in 1894 Coubertin set up the International Olympic Committee.

    Consequently, Dr Brookes is credited as a founding father of the modern Olympic Games, and one of the Olympic mascots for London 2012 was named Wenlock after the town.
