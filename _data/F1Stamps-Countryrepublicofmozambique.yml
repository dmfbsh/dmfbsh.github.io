      A mini sheet of stamps featuring Juan Manuel Fangio; Fangio dominated he first decade of F1 winning the World Drivers' Championship five times.  Fangio drove for a variety of teams which meant he drove a number of different cars including those from Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati.
      
      Fangio, unlike later F1 drivers, started his racing career at a mature age and was the oldest driver in many of his races.  During his career, drivers raced with almost no protective equipment on circuits with no safety features, although F1 cars back in the 1950s were a lot slower, less physically demanding to drive and less advanced than F1 cars four and more decades later.  Fangio had no compunction about leaving a team, even after a successful year or even during a season, if he thought he would have a better chance with a better car.  As was then common, several of his race results were shared with team mates after he took over their car during races when his own had technical problems.  His rivals included Alberto Ascari, Giuseppe Farina and Stirling Moss.  Throughout his career, Fangio was backed by funding from the Argentine government of Juan Peron.

      A mini sheet of one stamp featuring the Ferguson P99.
      
      The Ferguson P99 was a four-wheel drive F1 car built by Ferguson Research Ltd for the Rob Walker Racing Team.  It was the first 4WD F1 car and used a Climax 1.5 litre engine.  It is also the last front-engined car ever to win an F1 event - Stirling Moss drove it to victory at the International Gold Cup at Oulton Park in 1961.
      
      In a 1997 interview for Motor Sport magazine, Sir Stirling Moss nominated the P99 as his favourite of all the F1 cars he drove.  This was considered high praise from a man who drove the Mercedes W196, Maserati 250F, Vanwall and Cooper T51.
