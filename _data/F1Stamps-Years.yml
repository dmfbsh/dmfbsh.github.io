    The first official FIA Formula 1 race took place at Silverstone on 13th May 1950, the race was<br>
    won by Guiseppe Farina driving an Alfa Romeo. The first few years of the F1 World<br>
    Championship for Drivers were dominated by Juan Manuel Fangio and Alberto Ascari, and<br>
    Italian cars - Alfa Romeo, Ferrari and Maserati. Then in the mid-50s Mercedes Benz were a<br>
    force to be reckoned with. Later in the decade, the World Championship for Constructors was<br>
    introduced and British teams and drivers began to make their mark, most notably Mike<br>
    Hawthorn, Stirling Moss and Vanwall. The end of decade saw the Cooper cars bring in a<br>
    revolution with much success, that of putting the engine behind the driver, especially in the<br>
    hands of Jack Brabham.

    The early 1960s saw another revolution in the technology of the racing car - the Lotus 25 had an<br>
    aluminium sheet monocoque chassis instead of the traditional spaceframe design. This period<br>
    of Formula 1 history saw the British being dominant, with drivers like Graham Hill and Jim Clark<br>
    and the Lotus and BRM teams. However, Jack Brabham was still a force to be reckoned with,<br>
    now winning titles with his own cars. The late 1960s saw the introduction of the most dominant<br>
    engine in Formula 1 history, the Ford-Cosworth DFV. Also by the late 1960s about a third of the<br>
    races were being held outside of Europe, and safety was becoming a major issue.

    Sponsorship had arrived in Formula 1 at the end of the previous decade and was now becoming<br>
    established in the sport. In the 1970s, Lotus were still winning titles, but so were Ferrari; this<br>
    decade saw the emergence of two great names McLaren and Williams. The decade was<br>
    dominated by drivers like Emerson Fittipaldi, Jackie Stewart, Niki Lauda, James Hunt and<br>
    Jochen Rindt. The end of the 1970s saw the start of the ground effect era. There were still<br>
    many deaths in the sport; but also the remarkable recovery of Niki Lauda, driving his Ferrari just<br>
    six weeks after having been given the last rites - he missed out on the 1976 title by just one point<br>
    to James Hunt in the McLaren.

    McLaren merged with Ron Dennis's Formula Two Project-4 team and started to become a<br>
    hugely successful team, Williams and Ferrari also proved very successful. The decade saw<br>
    some titanic battles between drivers Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost, Nelson Piquet and Nigel<br>
    Mansell. Turbo-charged engines became the norm and by the mid to late 1980s some engines<br>
    were putting out more than 1,000bhp in qualifying trim, but by the end of the decade the turbos<br>
    were banned. With the removal of the turbos, more teams could afford to enter the sport so at<br>
    the end of the decade 39 drivers in 21 teams were competing for 26 places on the grid.
- Year: 1990

  Description: |
    McLaren and Williams continued to dominate throughout the 1990s, but towards the end of the<br>
    decade a new force was emerging - Michael Schumacher and Ferrari. In the early part of the<br>
    decade the cars were becoming more and more technically advanced with many driver aids<br>
    being developed - by the mid-1990s these were banned. In the early 1990s there was an air of<br>
    invincibility in Formula 1 as there had been no deaths for a few years, however, this was crushed<br>
    by the tragic events of the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. The FIA reacted with many changes<br>
    aimed at reducing speed and increasing safety. At the end of the decade the small privateer<br>
    teams began to disappear from the sport and the large motor manufacturers began to move<br>
    back in.

  Description: |
    The first half of the decade belonged to Michael Schumacher and Ferrari; only in the mid-2000s<br>
    was their dominance halted by a young Spanish driver (Fernando Alonso) and his Renault. An<br>
    increasing number of small teams disappeared from the grid and further manufacturers reentered<br>
    the sport. Both McLaren and Ferrari returned to form later in the decade, in 2007 Kimi<br>
    Raikkonen in the Ferrari won the title by one point from rookie Lewis Hamilton in the McLaren.<br>
    The end of the decade saw many rule changes including the introduction of KERS and<br>
    adjustable front wings. Honda pulled out of Formula 1 having struggled for many years, but the<br>
    team was kept going following a management buy out by Ross Brawn and both titles was the<br>
    reward for himself and Jenson Button.

  Description: |
    The early part of the decade saw many rule changes aimed at cost reduction and improving the<br>
    "show" for the fans - KERS was re-introduced after it had been banned and DRS was<br>
    introduced to increase overtaking. Red Bull Racing entered Formula 1 in 2010, buying the old<br>
    Jaguar team, they recruited top designer Adrian Newey who had had much success with<br>
    Williams and McLaren and with Sebastian Vettel dominated the early part of the decade.<br>
    Formula 1 continued to expand into new countries.
