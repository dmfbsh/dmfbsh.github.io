  Name: William Penny Brookes Born
  Description: |
    William Penny Brookes was an English surgeon, magistrate, botanist, and educationalist.  He established the Olympian Class of his Wenlock Agricultural Reading Society in 1850 to inspire local people to keep fit and take part in sports competitions.  Following the 1860 games, the Olympian Class was set up as the independent Wenlock Olympian Society.

    Brookes' campaign for physical education brought him into contact with Baron Pierre de Coubertin - in 1890, the young French aristocrat visited Much Wenlock and stayed with Dr Brookes at his lifelong home in Wilmore Street.  Coubertin was inspired by discussions with Brookes and a games staged for his visit - in 1894 Coubertin set up the International Olympic Committee.

    Consequently, Dr Brookes is credited as a founding father of the modern Olympic Games, and one of the Olympic mascots for London 2012 was named Wenlock after the town.
