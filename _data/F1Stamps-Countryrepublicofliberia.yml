      A minature perforated sheet containing 1 stamp featuring Enzo Ferrari.
      
      Enzo Anselmo "the Commendatore" Ferrari (February 20, 1898 - August 14, 1988) was an Italian race car driver and entrepreneur, the founder of the Scuderia Ferrari Grand Prix motor racing team, and subsequently of the Ferrari car manufacturer.
      
      In 1923, racing in Ravenna, he acquired the Prancing Horse badge which decorated the fuselage of Francesco Baracca's (Italy's leading ace of WWI) SPAD S.XIII fighter, given from his mother, taken from the wreckage of the plane after his mysterious death. This icon would have to wait until 1932 to be displayed on a racing car.
      
      Ferrari has participated in the Formula 1 World Championship since its introduction in 1950, but the first victory was not until the British Grand Prix of 1951. The first championship came in 1952-53, when the Formula One season was raced with Formula Two cars.
