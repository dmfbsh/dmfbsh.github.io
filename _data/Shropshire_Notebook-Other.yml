  Name: The Railway, Broseley
  Description: |
    Broseley developed as an industrial area due to the abundance of coal, clay, iron ore and limestone easily workable in one area, also the woods provided charcoal and the River Severn transport.  In fact, the mines in Broseley and the adjoining parish of Benthall became of national importance in the seventeenth century.

    This industrialisation drove innovation - a document of 1605 refers to a railway line from Birch Leasows, Broseley to the Calcutts, this is only the second railway for which evidence survives in England (making it one of the oldest railways in England).  A railway at the time would have horse drawn wagons on flanged wheels (meaning that greater loads could be moved with the same effort).
