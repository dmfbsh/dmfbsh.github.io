  Name: St Eata, Atcham
  Description: |
    The name Atcham is a contraction of Attingham, meaning "the home of Eata's people".

    This is the only church dedicated to St Eata of Hexham.

    A church was present on this site prior to 1075, this is known because the chronicler Orderic Vitalis (a Benedictine monk who wrote one of the great chronicles of 11th and 12th Century England) was baptised at the church on Easter Day in 1075.

    The oldest part of the present church is the nave which dates from the late Saxon or early Norman period.  The tower is probably late 12th Century, the chancel late 13th Century and the south porch is dated 1665.  The church was restored in the late 19th Century.

    The church is constructed from red and grey sandstone and incorporates some large blocks from the Roman city of Wroxeter.

  Name: St Margaret, Acton Scott
  Description: |
    Acton generally means "settlement (farm or estate) by the oaks" and the 'Scott' originates from the medieval name Reynold le. Scot who held a share in the manor in 1255.

    The settlement was registered as Actune in the Domesday Book.

    This is a church that has suffered at the hands of 19th Century restorers.

    Much of the masonry is Medieval, but the windows were all renewed in the 19th Century.  The porch was added in 1722 and the north chapel in 1820.

  Name: St Milburga, Beckbury
  Description: |
    Beckbury was included in the  Domesday Book and the name means Beocca's Fort or defended place (Beocca being a personal name).

    The parish was originally part of the estates of Wenlock Priory from at least 1120 AD and the connection is reflected in the dedication to St Milburga.

    The chancel is possibly 14th Century (in the Middle Ages, Beckbury was a dependent chapelry of the parish of Holy Trinity, Much Wenlock).  The nave and the tower were added in 1731.

  Name: St Leonard, Bridgnorth
  Description: |
    Although not mentioned in the Domesday book, there is Anglo-Saxon and Norman stonework in the fabric of the church and so it is likely that an earlier church stood on the site of the present church.

    During the Civil War the Parliamentarians used the church to store ammunition, this was ignited by a cannon shot - the north aisle and part of the south aisle were destroyed.  The roof and nave were rebuilt in 1662, but the church was not fully restored until 1860.

  Date: 1720 AD
  Name: Holy Trinity, Buildwas
  Description: |
    The name Buildwas may derive its name from the Saxon words 'beild' or 'belde' (a shelter). and 'was' (water), surrounded as it is on three sides by hills and on the fourth by the river Severn.  Another view is that the name is from the Old English 'waesse' which means 'swamp' or 'marsh' and is usually translated as 'land by a meanering river which floods and drains quickly'.

    The village of Buildwas has been recognised since 1086 as the first reference to it was made in the Domesday Book.

    There has been a church on the present site since medieval times, the present church dates from 1720.  The chancel was rebuilt in 1864, a painting from 1790 shows a shorter western turret with a flatter pyramid top - the present timber-framed belfry probably also dates from 1864.

    Within the church are memorial tablets to members of two local families who were closely linked to the Industrial Revolution.  In the churchyard, there are some unusual cast iron headstones and tombstones, which were cast locally.

    The oldest surviving part of the church is in the chancel; the nave and tower are later and date from the 14th Century.  In 1889-90 the church was extensively restored by Aston Webb, an English architect who designed the principal facade of Buckingham Palace and the main building of the Victoria and Albert Museum.

    The Old English name means Ford by the Fort.

  Date: 12th Century AD
  Name: St James, Cardington
  Description: |
    The presence of a church on the site is recorded in the Domesday Book.  In 1167, the village, including the church, was given to the Knights Templar (and was known as Templars' Cardington, allowing the people to share the privileges of the Knights).  It remained in their possession until 1308 (when the order was supressed).  The Knights were responsible for starting the building of the present church in the later part of the 12th century.  During the following century the chancel was rebuilt and extended, and the tower was added.  Further additions and alterations were made during the following three centuries, followed by the porch in 1639.

    The body of the church is constructed in sandstone rubble with ashlar dressings and has tiled roofs.  The south doorway contains a door dated 1648.

    In the churchyard is a sandstone sundial dating from the middle of the 18th century.

    In the Domesday Book the village is referred to as 'Cardintine under the Fief of Rainwald Vicecomes' and it is mentioned that there were 11 leagues of woodland.  The name 'Cardington' derives from an English chief and warrior named Carda, whose sons and followers were called the Cardinga.  They made their home where the village is, and the village they built became known as Cardington, or the town of the sons of Carda.

    In the church is a large monument to Chief Justice of Leighton of Plaish (died 1607), this Jacobean monument is the earliest in Shropshire which depicts the deceased lying on his side. 

    Judge Leighton was known as 'the hanging judge' (as was Judge Jeffries) as he condemned so many people to be hanged.  Amongst those condemned by Leighton was a local builder, who had come to the judge to ask to be pardoned for his crime.  The Judge promised him that if he would build him the finest set of chimneys he had ever yet built he would spare his life.  The builder did construct the chimneys (on Plaish Hall).  But after completing the job the Judge ordered the mans' eyes to be put out, and for him to be hanged from the same chimneys he had just built (so that he could build no more chimneys ever finer).  It is said that one can see the rope with which the builder was hanged.

  Date: 12th Century AD
  Name: St Laurence, Church Stretton
  Description: |
    The Domesday book makes reference to a church in the Manor existing before the Norman conquest, most likely a small wooden building.

    The name Stretton is derived from the old name Stratun which means 'tun' (settlement) near to the 'Street' or Roman Road.

    The Norman church was probably built around 1110 to 1130 as the region was growing in prosperity and population (and the Welsh boarder was quieter).

    The church was extended in circa 1214 AD - a new chancel, transcepts in the form of a cruciform and the lower tower were constructed.  A century or so later, the windows were enlarged and the tower was extended.

  Name: St Luke, Coalbrookdale
  Description: |
    With the support of the Darbys a new church was planned for the village of Coalbrookdale.  The foundation stone was laid by Abraham's wife, Matilda Frances, on 11th December 1851 and the completed building was consecrated by the Bishop of Hereford on 25th July 1854.

    The church is notable because unusually a number of the gravemarkers were locally cast in iron.

    The most notable grave is that of Abraham Darby IV and his Wife Matilda.

  Name: Christ Church, Cressage
  Description: |
    The name Cressage means "Christ's Oak", and so it is thought the village's location may be a very early Christian site (possibly an oak tree from where the gospel was preached).

    There was a medieval church at Cressage, but it suffered repeated flooding from the nearby river Severn and so the current church was built on higher ground.  The rather austere church was architected by Edward Haycock snr (Haycock was responsible for 14 churches in Shropshire, other work by him includes Millichope Park and the Lord Hill monument in Shrewsbury).

    The octagonal pulpit is made of panelling from St Samson's church (the old medieval church).

    Mentioned in the Doomsday book as Istefelt, the name Ightfield may derive from the Old English 'Ihtfeld' (Iht means creature and Feld means field), referring to the fact that the area was rural and farming was prevalent.  Alternatively, it is thought it could dervice from Giht, an ancient British river name.

    The church has 15th Century origins and was partly rebuilt in the 19th Century (although records show a church here dedicated to St John the Baptist in 1072 AD).

  Description: |
    The area was originally part of the parish of Madeley, but with the growth of the population due to the bridge, it was thought necessary for Ironbridge to have its own church.

    The position of Ironbridge church is the reverse of the majority of churches, the sanctuary is at the west end and the tower at the east end.  This is because the land at the west end would not bear the weight of a tower.

  Name: St Michael the Archangel, Llanyblodwel
  Description: |
    The present church was the result of rebuilding the old medieval church in stages between 1847 and 1853 by the then vicar.  The almost detached steeple was designed and added in 1855-6 by the same vicar, he was convinced that the shape would be stronger than the usual hollow spire construction where the thickness of the straight sides diminishes towards the apex.  The height is 104 ft (tower 57 ft and spire 47 ft).

  Name: St Laurence, Ludlow
  Description: |
    One of the greatest parish churches in England.

    Nothing remains of the original 11th Century church, but 100 years later a second church was built in a style of mixed Norman and early-English.  It is thought that a barrow was removed in 1199 to enlarge the churchyard.

    There was a massive rebuilding of the church between 1433 and 1471, much of which was paid for by the wealthy Palmers' Guild, which endowed a number of chantries in the church.

  Name: St Peter, Melverley
  Description: |
    Melverley means "meadow by the mill-ford".

    The church stands very close to the river Vyrnwy.

    The medieval church was burnt by Owain Glyndwr in 1401.  The present church was built soon after.

    It is noted for being one of just a small number of half timbered churches in the country.  The entire structure is held together with just pegs.  The fact that the wattle and daub is narrower than the timbers shows the early construction of this church using this technique.

  Description: |
    In 642 AD Oswald, the King of Northumbria who had previously converted to Christianity was killed by the pagan King Penda of Mercia in the Battle of Oswestry, as a result he rose to martyrdom.  He is thought to have been killed on the site of the church.

    The present church was built in the 13th Century.

  Name: St Alkmund, Shrewsbury
  Description: |
    St Alkmund died circa 802 AD, he was the younger son of Alhred (king of Northumbria) at Lilleshall, his relics were removed to the collegiate church dedicated to him at Derby.  This church in Shrewsbury was also founded as a collegiate church in 912 AD by Aethelflaed, daughter of Alfred the Great, king of Mercia.  By the time of the Domesday survey, the church was substantially endowed.  However, when Lilleshall Abbey was established in 1148 AD, the church became an poor vicarage as property was transferred to Lilleshall.

    The church stands at the highest point in the town.

    The original Medieval church is thought to have been a very fine example.  However, following the collapse of Old St Chad's in 1788, there was concern about the safety of the church.  An act of Parliament decreed the demolition and rebuilding of all but the tower.

    The present tower and spire were built around 1475 AD.  The rest of the present church is Georgian.

  Name: St Bartholomew, Tong
  Description: |
    Sometimes referred to as the 'Westminster Abbey of the Midlands'; the church is noted for its architecture which includes a fan vaulted side chapel (which is rare in Shropshire) and its numerous tombs.

    The church was founded by the widowed Isabel Lingen as a chantry and collegiate church.  The commission to dissolve the college was issued on 17th September 1546 and referred to the legislation that permitted the king's commissioners to seize property on his behalf.

    The church is a cruciform building (rare for the Perpendicular era) and is built of red sandstone (which is abundant locally).  The church is noted for its bourdon bell which weighs over 2 tonnes and is called the Great Bell of Tong - claimed to be the loudest and biggest bell in Shropshire.  It had been feared that the tower would not support continued tolling, so it is rung only on certain days / occasions which gives the vicar of the church an equal status with the local noble families and the sitting monarch.

  Name: St Lucy, Upton Magna
  Description: |
    Magna is Latin, meaning "great", so the translation of Upton Magna is "Great Upton".

    The nave and chancel are originally Norman, as is the south doorway of the Nave.  Some original masonry survives in the chancel but the church was substantially rebuilt and enriched by the architect G E Street (best known as the designer of the Royal Courts of Justice) in the 1850s and 1860s.  The tower is Perpendicular (he final phase of Gothic architecture, which spanned the late 14th century to the early 16th century).

    This church is the only one in Shropshire dedicated to St Lucy (a Christian martyr who died during the Diocletianic Persecution - the last and most severe persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire).

  Description: |
    The present church was preceeded by a Saxon or Norman church, a medieval building dating from 1391 and church built in 1788 which became inadequate for the needs of the parish and fell into disrepair.  In 1861 a new building was commissioned from the leading architect of the day Sir George Gilbert Scott.  The walls are of yellow sandstone ashlar; the church has a slate roof which has a lozenge pattern over the nave and a zig-zag pattern over the chancel.

    Welshampton is recorded in the Domesday book as Hantone, meaning high settlement.

    An African prince is buried in the churchyard - the then vicar was as offered a post in Lesotho, which he turned down but maintained contact with the country.  The prince came to England to train as a priest and visited Welshampton when the new church was consecrated in 1863, but during the visit he caught a fever and died and so was buried at the church.

  Name: St Alkmund, Whitchurch
  Description: |
    Whitchurch is the oldest continually inhabited town in Shropshire.

    Whitchurch acquired its present name after the construction of a Norman church in white Grinshill stone (replacing a wooden Saxon church), from the Middle English for "White Church".  Originally a Roman settlement it was half way between Wroxeter and Chester and so was known as Mediolanum (the place in the middle of the plain).  In the Doomsday book it was known as Westune (indicating its situation on the Western border of England).

    The Norman church was extended in Medieval times, but collaspsed on Sunday 31st July 1711.

    The present church was built on the same site, this time of red sandstone.

  Name: St Peter, Wrockwardine
  Description: |
    The church is mentioned in the Domesday book and so is thought to be of Saxon origin.  The current church is of Norman origin (with modifiications being made in the 14th Century).  The plan of the church forms a cruciform with the tower at the cross point, a less common layout (when compared with the more usual configuration of siting the tower at the east or west end of the building).

    The name Wrockwardine is derived from the words meaning "enclosure or settlement by the Wrekin" - Wrekin is the British name for Wroxeter (and is the name given to the nearby hill).
