  Name: St Mary, Acton Burnell
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1275 AD
  Description: |
    This church is considered to be the finest Early English (13th Century) church in Shropshire.  Unlike most English parish churches, Acton Burnell is built in a same style throughout.

    It features a corbel-table with many grotesque carvings (a corbel-table is a continuous row of corbels, and a corbel is a block of stone projecting from a wall and supporting some heavy feature).

    Acton generally means 'settlement (farm or estate) by the oaks' and this estate belonged to Robert Burnell an English bishop who served as Lord Chancellor of England from 1274 to 1292.

  Name: St Margaret, Acton Scott
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th-14th Century AD
  Description: |
    This is a church that has suffered at the hands of 19th Century restorers.  Much of the masonry is medieval, but the windows were all renewed in the 19th Century.  The porch was added in 1722 and the north chapel in 1820.

    Acton generally means 'settlement (farm or estate) by the oaks' and the 'Scott' originates from the medieval name Reynold le. Scot who held a share in the manor in 1255.

    The settlement was registered as Actune in the Domesday Book.

  Name: St Peter, Adderley
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1635-1636 AD
  Description: |
    The oldest existing part of the present church is the north transept, which was built in 1635-36 as a burial chapel for the Needham family, the Viscounts Kilmorey of Shavington.  Sir Robert Needham was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Shropshire by 1596, a deputy lieutenant of the county in 1600 and High Sheriff of Shropshire for 1606–07.  He was a member of the Council in the Marches of Wales in 1609 and vice-president of the council in 1614.  He was a Member of the Parliament of England for Shropshire in 1593 and 1604 and was created Viscount Kilmorey in 1625.

    The other remaining part of the older church is the tower, built in 1712.  The rest of the church was built in 1801 by Richard Baker; it is the only known work by this architect.  The chancel was restored in 1822.  The interior of the church was separated into two parts in circa 1970 (although the church records show this as having taken place in 1956) so that the nave could continue as the parish church and rest preserved by the Churches Conservation Trust.

    The church is constructed in yellow-grey sandstone, with some red sandstone in the tower.

    The cast iron window frames were made locally at Coalbrookdale, and for this reason the church is Grade I listed.

    At the entrance to the north transept the carved wooden screen dates from circa 1637.  The font is Norman and is thought it may be a piece of stone taken from Wroxeter (upside column?).  The hexagonal pulpit dates from 1801.  The stained glass consists of 12 heraldic panels containing the Needham family arms.  The brass in the floor dates from circa 1390, it is thought that the head was removed in the Civil War.  The other brass commemorates Sir Robert Needham who died in 1556 and his wife who died in 1560.  This brass was lifted in circa 1970 and was found to be a ‘palimpsest’, i.e. an earlier brass (probably 14th Century and Flemish in origin), which had been cut up and reused.

    The mounting block of four sandstone steps dates from 1774.

    The name of the village derives from the Old English meaning 'Ealdthryth's wood/clearing', a leah (Old English) is a forest, wood, glade or clearing; (later) a pasture or a meadow.

  Name: St Michael, Alberbury
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1290 AD
  Description: |
    The church is thought to have been founded between the 7th and 10th Centuries.  It was originally a Minster Church (Minster was the Anglo-Saxon version of a monastery, and was originally applied to churches served by monks / clergy living a communal life and endowed by a charter with the obligation of maintaining the daily office of prayer, but was not the seat of a bishop and the church had no diocesan responsibilities).

    In the mid-12th century the church was given Shrewsbury Abbey, but was later assigned to Alberbury Priory.  The priory was founded in 1228 and was one of three dependencies of the French abbey of Grandmont (the priory itself was sited about one and a quarter miles away by the river Severn).  Being an 'alien' priory it was vulnerable to predators representing the king, the priory was finally suppressed by the king in 1441 and the estate passed to All Souls' college, Oxford.

    The church was reconsecrated in 1290, following the cessation of a long-running series of Welsh border disputes.

    The tower is Early English (approx. 1180 to 1270), it has a saddleback roof (a ridge and two sloping sides) - the only example of such in Shropshire.

    The roof of the nave is thought to be one of the finest in the county.

    The Loton Chapel was added in 1320, and contains a pre-Raphaelite window by Burne Jones.

    There are two wall-monuments to Sir Richard Lyster, who was MP for Shrewsbury in the 18th Century, the imagery on one refers to a scene in the House of Commons when he protested against a decision of the House.

    The place name derives from the Old English 'burh' (a fortified place) and the personal name Aluburg or Ealhburg.

  Name: St Mary, Astley
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    From the time of the Anglo-Saxons until 1860 the Church was a chapel to the Collegiate Church of St Mary in Shrewsbury.  At the time of the Domesday survey a priest is mentioned, indicating the existence of a church building.  The earliest part of the present building dates from about 100 years after the Domesday survey.

    The tower was built in 1837.

    The church was restored in 1883.

    The rood screen, altar and reredos date from the 1930s when the chancel was re-organised.

    The church is notable as it has a bell dating from 1270, which is thought to have been cast in the churchyard by a travelling founder.  The bell was rehung in 2012 after being restored.  It is thought to be one of, if not the, oldest bells in the county and the diocese.

    The name of the village in old English means 'east wood or clearing' (east and leah) and this is in relation to Albrighton.

  Name: St Eata, Atcham
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: Before 1075 AD
  Description: |
    This is the only church in England dedicated to St Eata of Hexham.

    The first church to St Eata is said to have been built in the 8th Century but there is no longer any trace of this.  The present church has been on this site since at least 1075, this is known because the chronicler Orderic Vitalis (a Benedictine monk who wrote one of the great chronicles of 11th and 12th Century England) was baptised at the church on Easter Day in 1075.

    The oldest part of the present church is the nave which dates from the late Saxon or early Norman period.  The tower is probably late 12th Century, the chancel late 13th Century and the south porch is dated 1665.  The church was restored in the late 19th Century.

    The church is constructed from red and grey sandstone and incorporates some large blocks from the Roman city of Wroxeter.

    The name Atcham is a contraction of Attingham, meaning 'the home of Eata's people'.

  Name: All Saints, Baschurch
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century
  Description: |
    Some parts of the church are Norman (and date from the 12th Century).  The bottom four stages of the tower were constructed in the early 13th Century.  The top stage was added in circa 1400.

    The church was restored in 1790 by Thomas Telford.  Further restorations were carried out in the late 19th Century.

    The font dates from 1681, and there are monuments to Thomas Corbet, dated 1615, and Thomas Slaney M.P. for Shrewsbury, who served in eight parliaments.  There is also is an old chained Bible, given in 1770 by the Rev. Robert Jeffreys, vicar here for 58 years, who died in 1800.

    The stained glass in the east window is by Kempe (1886).

    The English name Baschurch first appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Bascherche, but the earliest references to Baschurch are under its Welsh name Eglwyssau Bassa (Churches of Bassa), in a seven-stanza englyn-poem of the same name found in the Welsh cycle of poems called Canu Heledd, generally thought to date to the ninth century.

  Name: St Mary Magdalene, Battlefield
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1406 AD
  Description: |
    The church was built just after the Battle of Shrewsbury as a chantry - a place of intercession and commemoration for those killed in the fighting.  The building is probably constructed over a mass burial pit as it is thought that some of the battle was fought at the place now known as Battlefield.

    The church was originally a collegiate church, the main duty of the community was to perform a daily liturgy for the dead.  The college and chantry were dissolved in 1548 and the building was used as a parish church.  The building, however, deteriorated and became unused, it has been subject to various restorations.

  Date: 14th Century AD
  Description: |
    Beckbury was included in the Domesday Book and the name means Beocca's Fort or defended place (Beocca being a personal name).

    The parish was originally part of the estates of Wenlock Priory from at least 1120 AD and the connection is reflected in the dedication to St Milburga.  In the Middle Ages, Beckbury was a dependent chapelry of the parish of Holy Trinity, Much Wenlock.

  Name: St Bartholomew, Benthall
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1667 AD
  Description: |
    At the time of the Domesday Book, the settlement was most likely part of the manor at Much Wenlock.  During the Middle Ages, there was a chapel at Benthall which was dedicated to St Brice, and which was dependent on Wenlock Priory.

    The chapel was destroyed in the Civil War and the present church was built to replace it.  The church is considered to be a fine example of a restoration era (the post Civil War Stuart period) church. The church was extended in the late 19th Century.

    There is a vertical sun dial on the church with an eye constructed of glass tesserae.

    St Bartholomew was the patron saint of bees.  At one time a bee hive was kept in the church, the honey was sold or given away to help the poor of the community.  The bees used to access the hive through the mouth of the lion's head carving which is just beneath the sun dial.

    The place-name means 'nook of land where the bent-grass grows', this derives from the Old English 'beonet' whicn means bent-grass and 'halh' (Anglian) which means a nook of land, a small valley, dry ground in marsh, or a piece of land projecting from, or detached from, the main area of its administrative unit.

  Name: St John the Baptist, Bishops Castle
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 13th Century AD
  Description: |
    Bishop's Castle is named from the castle built there by the Bishop of Hereford in circa 1127.

    The original church was built towards the end of the 13th century to serve the medieval town controlled by the Bishops of Hereford.  Only the tower remains of the original church (but this was rebuilt in 1648 after the church was badly damaged in 1645 during the Civil War).  The rest of the church was completely re-built in 1869-60 by Thomas Nicholson in the Victorian Gothic style.

    During the rebuild, an Early English (1180-1275) doorway was removed and is now in the wall of the vicarage garden.  Also from the old church are a plain Norman font and a demi-figure of an Elizabethan divine (now upright).  Some of the stained glass is Pre-Raphaelite, other windows are considered fine examples of Victorian glass and are by Powell’s, O’Connor and Henry Holiday.

  Name: St Leonard, Bridgnorth
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    Although not mentioned in the Domesday book, there is Anglo-Saxon and Norman stonework in the fabric of the church and so it is likely that an earlier church stood on the site of the present church.

    During the Civil War the Parliamentarians used the church to store ammunition, this was ignited by a cannon shot - the north aisle and part of the south aisle were destroyed.  The roof and nave were rebuilt in 1662, but the church was not fully restored until 1860.

  Name: St Mary the Virgin, Bromfield
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: Anglo- Saxon / Norman
  Description: |
    In Anglo-Saxon times Bromfield was an important collegiate church with 12 canons.  In circa 1060 Edward the Confessor issued a writ to the canons granting extensive liberties.  It was described as being a wealthy minster of royal foundation.  

    The church is mentioned in the Domesday book and Bromfield is described as a holding of St Mary's, Shrewsbury.

    During the early 12th Century the canons were gradually replaced by monks and a Benedictine priory was established in 1155 AD (Henry II granted the charter); the priory was subject to the abbey in Gloucester.

    The priory took over part of the existing parish church, which had been rebuilt in the 12th Century with a cruciform plan, possibly with a tower at the crossing.  At some point the tower and the north transept disappeared, possibly following the fall of the tower.  The present tower is 13th Century.

    The priory was dissolved in 1540 AD and the buildings were taken over by Charles Foxe - he incorporated the present chancel (the former crossing) into his residence and it was divided into two stories.  The south transept was converted to form the rest of the house.  There are still parts of the Tudor residence in the grounds of the present church.

    In the 17th Century the house was damaged by fire and the occupants moved away.  The church was restored for worship in 1658 AD.

    The church was further restored in 1889-90 by Hodgson Fowler (a prolific ecclesiastical architect of the Victorian era) who also designed the triptych behind the altar.

    The oldest feature in the church is the Norman chancel arch.

    The chancel has a Baroque painted ceiling by Cheshire artist Thomas Francis (1672).  On the south wall of the nave is the Royal Coat of Arms of Charles II - one the largest in existence.  Most of the stained glass is by Kempe (a renowned designer and manufacturer of stained glass in the Victorian era).  The Saints featured in the west window are all female, which in unusual.

    The name of the settlement means 'broomy' open land (brom is the Old English for Broom (a thorny bush or shrub) and feld is the Old English open country or unencumbered ground.

  Name: All Saints, Broseley
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1845 AD
  Description: |
    This church is considered to be the finest early Victorian church in the county, and is constructed throughout in an authentic Perpendicular style.  It is built of stone from Grinshill.

    In the late 16th and early 17th Centuries, the wooded parish of Broseley expanded as the coal-mining industry grew, there was further expansion in the 18th Century with increasing industry in the area.  This made the existing church unsuitable for the increasing population.

    In the early 1700's, what was probably the original medieval church, was completely rebuilt and finished in 1716.  The present church then replaced this building.  When the new church was consecrated the dedication was changed from St Leonard to All Saints.

    The church contains a window by Kempe.

    A settlement existed at Broseley in 1086 and is listed as Bosle in the Domesday Book.  The name of the town likely derives from either the Old English for town's guardian (burh-weard) or the Old English personal name Burgweard, and the Old English leah meaning a forest, wood, glade or clearing (and later a pasture or meadow).

  Name: Holy Trinity, Buildwas
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1720 AD
  Description: |
    The name Buildwas may derive its name from the Saxon words 'beild' or 'belde' (a shelter). and 'was' (water), surrounded as it is on three sides by hills and on the fourth by the river Severn.  Another view is that the name is from the Old English 'waesse' which means 'swamp' or 'marsh' and is usually translated as 'land by a meanering river which floods and drains quickly'.

    The village of Buildwas has been recognised since 1086 as the first reference to it was made in the Domesday Book.

    There has been a church on the present site since medieval times, the present church dates from 1720.  The chancel was rebuilt in 1864, a painting from 1790 shows a shorter western turret with a flatter pyramid top - the present timber-framed belfry probably also dates from 1864.

    Within the church are memorial tablets to members of two local families who were closely linked to the Industrial Revolution.  In the churchyard, there are some unusual cast iron headstones and tombstones, which were cast locally.

  Name: St Michael, Cardeston
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1276 AD
  Description: |
    The church is known to have existed prior to 1276, as there is one window in the chancel in the present building from before that date.  By the 18th Century, the medieval church was in a poor state of repair and it was replaced by a new building in 1749, the building was significantly remodelled in 1844.  The church needed further restoration in 1905.

    The church is notable for its unusual tower (which was added in 1844) as the square lower stage becomes octagonal above angle broaches.  The architect of the tower, vestry and new windows in the nave was Thomas Jones of Chester who had been employed by the Leightons at Loton Park and in Alberbury church.  Three designs were were proposed, a square tower, a spire and a square base with an octagonal tower.  In medieval times, an octagon was considered to be halfway between a circle (God) and a square (the Earth).  It was the place where heaven and earth came into contact.  This is why pulpits and fonts are often octagonal in shape.

    To fund the building of a tower, £500 was donated by Lady Leighton from the proceeds of her published engraved picture of The Ladies of Llangollen.  The engraved picture was based on a sketch by Mary Parker a friend of The Ladies of Llangollen who often visited and secretly drew their portraits as they were unwilling to have their portraits taken formally.

    The village name means Card's farm/settlement (Card being a personal name).

  Name: St James, Cardington
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The presence of a church on the site is recorded in the Domesday Book.  In 1167, the village, including the church, was given to the Knights Templar (and was known as Templars' Cardington, allowing the people to share the privileges of the Knights).  It remained in their possession until 1308 (when the order was supressed).  The Knights were responsible for starting the building of the present church in the later part of the 12th Century.  During the following century the chancel was rebuilt and extended, and the tower was added.  Further additions and alterations were made during the following three centuries, followed by the porch in 1639.

    The body of the church is constructed in sandstone rubble with ashlar dressings and has tiled roofs.  The south doorway contains a door dated 1648.

    In the churchyard is a sandstone sundial dating from the middle of the 18th Century.

    In the Domesday Book the village is referred to as 'Cardintine under the Fief of Rainwald Vicecomes' and it is mentioned that there were 11 leagues of woodland.  The name 'Cardington' derives from an English chief and warrior named Carda, whose sons and followers were called the Cardinga.  They made their home where the village is, and the village they built became known as Cardington, or the town of the sons of Carda.

    In the church is a large monument to Chief Justice of Leighton of Plaish (died 1607), this Jacobean monument is the earliest in Shropshire which depicts the deceased lying on his side. 

    Judge Leighton was known as 'the hanging judge' (as was Judge Jeffries) as he condemned so many people to be hanged.  Amongst those condemned by Leighton was a local builder, who had come to the judge to ask to be pardoned for his crime.  The Judge promised him that if he would build him the finest set of chimneys he had ever yet built he would spare his life.  The builder did construct the chimneys (on Plaish Hall).  But after completing the job the Judge ordered the mans' eyes to be put out, and for him to be hanged from the same chimneys he had just built (so that he could build no more chimneys ever finer).  It is said that one can see the rope with which the builder was hanged.

    The place name is thought to derive from the Old English Cegel, meaning pole, as it is believed that the marsh may have been marked out by posts.

  Name: St Michael the Archangel, Chirbury
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    An Anglo-Saxon church was founded circa 915 when a fort was built on the site.  The current building dates from the 12th Century.  The aisles and arcades were added in the 13th Century - the arcades noticeably lean outwards.  The tower was constructed around 1300 and the chancel was added in 1733.  The church was restored in 1871-72.  The tower and body of the church were constructed using limestone rubble with pink sandstone ashlar dressings and slate roofs.  The chancel is red brick with a tiled roof.

    In the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle the place name was recorded as Cyricbyrig.  Later in 1086 in the Domesday book, the place name was recorded as Cireberie which means 'a fortified place with a church'.

    The church was reformed into the church of the Augustinian Priory at Chirbury when the order relocated from Snead (near Bishop's Castle) round about 1220.  With the dissolution of the Priory in 1535, the church became a parish church once again.  The church as seen today is the nave of the Priory.

  Name: St John the Baptist, Church Preen
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 13th Century
  Description: |
    The church was built in the 13th Century and is 70 feet long by 13foot wide. It was originally a monastic church, which explains the appearance. The church was founded as a cell of Wenlock Priory in 1163 when the manor was granted to the priory.  The monastic cell survived as a priory until 1534.  The church was probably built circa 1200 AD.

    The west wall collapsed during restoration in 1866, the bell-turret and roof date from this time.

    The pulpit is Jacobean.

    Although the priory buildimgs survived until the 18th Century, they were demolished and replaced by the present Preen Manor in 1870.

    In the churchyard is one of the oldest and largest yew trees in the country.

    The name of the village is thought to be derived from the Old English 'preon' meaning pin or brooch which describes the shape of the nearest hill.

  Name: St Edith, Church Pulverbatch
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1773 AD 
  Description: |
    The name Pulverbatch means the valley of the river Pulre.  The village of Church Pulverbatch is also known as Churton.  The manor is recorded in the Domesday book as Polrebec.

    The medieval church (the church's first known priest was 'John the Chaplain', recorded before 1193) was destroyed by the Welsh some time around 1400, the successor building was constructed in the Georgian style in 1773.  However, the nave, chancel and north aisle were restored in the 1850s.

    The churchyard contains a number of tombs of interest, including an urn shaped tomb dating from the 18th Century.  The churchyard is circular and was thought to have been a defensive site, there are a number of mature yew trees in the churchyard.

  Name: St Laurence, Church Stretton
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The Domesday book makes reference to a church in the Manor existing before the Norman conquest, most likely a small wooden building.

    The name Stretton is derived from the old name Stratun which means 'tun' (settlement) near to the 'Street' or Roman Road.

    The Norman church was probably built around 1110 to 1130 as the region was growing in prosperity and population (and the Welsh boarder was quieter).

    The church was extended in circa 1214 AD - a new chancel, transcepts in the form of a cruciform and the lower tower were constructed.  A century or so later, the windows were enlarged and the tower was extended.

  Name: All Saints, Claverley
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The church can trace its origins back to the 7th Century (Saxon), however, the present church dates from the 12th Century.

    Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, held the manor and the church was connected with the collegiate foundation which he endowed at Quatford.

    The church was added to in the 13th and 15th Centuries - the tower was doubled in height and angle buttresses were added to it towards the end of the 15th century.  At about the same time the north chapel was added.

    The church is noted for the medieval wall paintings which have been dated to circa 1200.

    The name Claverley means 'clover meadow'.

  Name: St Margaret, Clee St Margaret
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: Saxon / Norman
  Description: |
    The name of the village derives from the Old English 'cleo' (clee) meaning a ball, used in this case to mean a ball-shaped hill (referring to the distictive shape of the Clee Hills) and the saint to which the church is dedicated.

    The exact date of the church is unknown, although there was probably a Saxon church on the site.  The most notable feature of the present building is the extensive herring-bone masonry.

  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    Cleobury passed to the Mortimer family (one of the great Marcher families) after the Norman conquest.

    The church is largely Early English.  The arcades lean outwards and were first stabilised by Thomas Telford in the 1790s, buttresses were added later.

    The shingled spire is not quite symmetrical when seen from certain viewpoints.

  Name: All Saints, Clive
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: circa 1190 AD
  Description: |
    Evidence suggests there was a little wooden church at the site in 599 AD (and noted in St Augustine’s record of early Christian sites).  By Anglo-Saxon times the chapelry was held by the collegiate Church of St Mary, Shrewsbury.  Strong links were also established Haughmond Abbey as Clive was a profitable parish (although small).  By 1578 the parishioners had taken matters into their hands and raised sufficient funds to repair the chapel and appoint their own Minister.

    The first major restoration occured from 1628-54.  A second rebuilding programme took place in 1849.  Finally, the church was fully restored in 1885-87 (made possible by the patronage of J J Bibby owner of the Liverpool shipping line and Hardwicke Grange and Thomas Meares, a tea plantation owner living at Clive Hall).  The spire was added in 1894 at the expense of J J Bibby in memory of his wife.  There is some medieval masonry remaining in the north wall and the north doorway (late Norman) was preserved from the original church.

    The peal of six bells is the heaviest in the county, they were installed on 22nd September 1894 having been ordered in November 1892 from the John Taylor Bell Factory of Loughborough (at a total cost of £1,432.18s.7d).  The collective weight requiring support has been calculated as in excess of 81 hundredweight or over 4 tons, and this set is currently ranked as the eleventh heaviest peal of six in the world, this standing calculated according to the weight of the large Tenor bell which alone weighs over 25 hundredweight.

    The organ is an original by Henry Wills (Wills is regarded as the foremost organ builder of the Victorian era).

    The name of settlement simply derives from the Old English ‘clif’ meaning an escarpment or hill slope.

  Name: Holy Trinity, Coalbrookdale
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1854 AD
  Description: |
    With the support of the Darbys a new church was planned for the village of Coalbrookdale.  The foundation stone was laid by Abraham's wife, Matilda Frances, on 11th December 1851 and the completed building was consecrated by the Bishop of Hereford on 25th July 1854.

    The church is notable because unusually a number of the gravemarkers were locally cast in iron.

    The most notable grave is that of Abraham Darby IV and his Wife Matilda.

  Name: St Andrew and St Mary, Condover
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    In Anglo-Saxon times, Condover was a minster church served by a college of priests and so was the centre of an extensive parish - there were a number of dependent chapelries in nearby settlements.  Before the Norman invasion the manor was held by Edward the Confessor.  The Domesday book mentions the presence of a priest, but all trace of the original building has been lost.

    It is thought that masonry from buildings at the Roman City at Wroxeter has been incorporated into the fabric of the church.

    The medieval church was substantially destroyed in 1660 when the tower collapsed.  The Norman north transcept and the Early English chancel were all that were left intact.  The church was rebuilt in 1662-64.  The chancel was then rebuilt again in 1867-68 by Reginald Cholmondeley, who was lord of the manor.  The hammer beam roof also dates from the 17th Century.

    The church is one largest country churches in Shropshire.  The church contains a notable collection of monuments.

    The churchyard contains one of the finest collections of church monuments in Shropshire, the earliest from the 16th century.  Most of these monuments and family tombs date from the 18th and 19th centuries.

    The name of the village means bank or ridge by the River Cound, the suffix 'ofer' is the Old English word meaning the tip of a promontory or a flat-topped ridge.

    In the Domesday book the name of the village is recorded as Conendovre.

  Name: St Peter, Cound
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 13th Century AD
  Description: |
    The church is dedicated to St Peter because of its medieval association with Shrewsbury Abbey, which is dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul.

    The oldest part of the church is the nave which dates from the 13th Century, and although the south aisle was built at the same time as the nave it was rebuilt a century later.  Since then the church has been added to quite considerably.  The tower was added in the 15th Century and in 1841/1842 the north aisle was built.  In 1862 the chancel was built and in 1889-91 the vestry was added re-using the 13th-century priest's door.

    The church is constructed in red and yellow sandstone.  In the older parts of the building the colours are used randomly, and for the 19th Century additions the blocks are deliberately arranged.

    The interior has many features of interest including the font which dates from the 12th Century (Norman) and the Pulpit which is dates 1633 (Jacobean).  In the chancel are re-used medieval tiles.  Over the chancel arch is part of a 15th Century wall painting of the Last Judgement.  There are many monuments on the interior walls.  In the churchyard is a sandstone cross base dating from the 18th Century or earlier.

    The name of the village is taken from the nearby brook, Cound Brook.  In the Domesday book, the manor was recorded as Cuneet.

  Name: Christ Church, Cressage
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1841 AD
  Description: |
    The name Cressage means 'Christ's Oak', and so it is thought the village's location may be a very early Christian site (possibly an oak tree from where the gospel was preached).

    There was a medieval church at Cressage, but it suffered repeated flooding from the nearby river Severn and so the current church was built on higher ground.  The rather austere church was architected by Edward Haycock snr (Haycock was responsible for 14 churches in Shropshire, other work by him includes Millichope Park and the Lord Hill monument in Shrewsbury).

    The octagonal pulpit is made of panelling from St Samson's church (the old medieval church).

  Name: St Mary, Eaton Constantine
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1841 AD
  Description: |
    Eaton Constantine was originally a dependent chapelry of Leighton but became a separate parish in the later Middle Ages.  The original church was replaced in 1841 by the present building.

    The only item remaining from the old church is the Norman font.

    The name Eaton Constantine is derived from the old English words for river and farm/settlement (ea and tun respectively).  The settlement was held by Thomas de Constentin family in 1242.

  Name: St Peter, Edgmond
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1080 AD
  Description: |
    The original Norman church was enlarged in the 13th Century, when the tower, porch and aisle were added.  It was then and almost completely rebuilt during the following two centuries, re-using some of the 13th Century material.  The church was further restored in 1877–78 by G E Street (best known as the designer of the Royal Courts of Justice).

    Inside, the stone reredos dates from 1899 and was designed by Bodley and Garner, it depicts the Crucifixion and saints.  The window in the south wall of the chancel is by William Morris (1876), it depicts the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene.  The west window beyond the bell ringing chamber was created by Hardman in the nineteenth century, it shows St. Francis at the centre and the wonders of creation. The font is early Norman.

    The painted sundial on the exterior is 18th Century.

    The name Edgmond means 'Ecgmund's hill' - the settlement is situated at the summit of a hill 200-250 ft above sea level.

  Name: St Mary, Edstaston
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century
  Description: |
    The church was subsidiary chapel in the parish of Wem until 1850.  The original church is Norman, both the nave and chancel date from this period.  Under the eaves of the north and south walls is a complete Norman corbel-table of trefaoil arches.

    The east wall was largely rebuilt in about 1300.  The south porch was added around 1710. The west end was shortened and rebuilt in about 1723; the roof timbers in the nave are also dated 1723.

    The church is notable as it has the finest Norman doorways in Shropshire.

    There are traces of medieval wall paintings in the nave and the chancel.

    The bellcote was dded in the 19th Century.

    In the north wall of the nave is a large Norman recess. In the east wall of the chancel is a 14th-century aumbry and piscina.  The tub font dates from the 12th century.  The pulpit is Jacobean.

    One of the windows in the south wall of the nave contains fragments of 15th-century stained glass; the rest of the glass dates from the 19th century.

    In the Domesday book the settlement was recorded as Stanestun.  The name of the settlement derives from the Old English for "Eadstan's settlement or farm" (tun being the Old English for a famstead or settlement).

  Name: St Michael, Ford
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: circa 1200 AD
  Description: |
    At the time of the Domesday survey, the manor at Ford was one of the most prosperous in the county.  The church occupies the highest site in the village.

    The nave and chancel originally date from circa 1200, but very little of the medieval building remains.  Most of the present building dates from 1875 when the church was restored.

    The church is most noted for the 15th Century roof of the nave, which consists of alternate hammer beams and collar beams with arched braces; at the sides are three tiers of cusped wind-braces.

    The screen is late Perpendicular and the reredos is Jacobean woodwork with five panels of human figures said to be of 16th Century Flemish workmanship.

    The name of the village derives from the fact that there are one or more fords across the river Severn in near proximity to the settlement (just to the north).

  Name: St John, Great Wollaston
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1788 AD
  Description: |
    The present church was built in 1788. It replaced a former chapel dating from 1300 AD and was constructed using rubble from the old chapel. From 1864 to 1871 this was the parish church of Great Wollaston. In 1871 the church at Middletown became the parish church because there was no land available in Great Wollaston for a burial ground.

    The church was considerably restored in 1855.

    The name of the village derives from a personal name (perhaps ‘Wiglaf’) and the old English for a farmstead or settlement (tun).

  Name: All Saints, Grinshill
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1839-40 AD
  Description: |
    The church is a rare example of a new-Norman church and is built of red Grinshill sandstone.

    The chancel screen was carved by six parishioners and presented in 1898 in commemoration of Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee.  The pulpit was given in 1900 and the font in 1889.

    Grinshill was originally a chapelry of Shawbury (known to be so as early as 1130 AD) and was an independent church by the 17th Century.  It has been suggested that some remains of prior buildings do exist at the base of the tower.

    The origin of the name of settlement is uncertain, it may mean ‘trap hill’ (perhaps where animals were snared or it maybe describes the shape of the hill).  Grynel is an unknown Old English word, but maybe related to the word ‘grin’ for a noose or snare.  Hyll is the Anglian for a hill or elevated ground.

  Name: St Mary Magdalene, Hadnall
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1140 to 1150 AD
  Description: |
    The church was originally a chapel of ease (a church built within the bounds of a parish for those who could not easily attend the parish church), the Norman nave is thought to date from 1140 to 1150.  It is thought that the nave may have been rebuilt in the 14th Century.  The tower was added in the 1830s and the chancel was built in 1874.

    General Sir Rowland Hill (died in 1842), who was Wellington's second in command at the Battle of Waterloo is buried in a sealed crypt beneath the tower and there is a monument to him in the church.

    The name of the village is derived from the Old English meaning 'Headda's nook of land' ('halh' is a nook of land or a piece of land detached from the main area of its administrative unit).

  Name: St Michael, High Ercall
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century
  Description: |
    At the time of the Domesday book, High Ercall was one of the most prosperous manors in the county.

    The present church replaced an earlier church built at the end of the 11th Century and probably dedicated to Edward the Confessor.

    The church was damaged in the Civil War; the extent of the damage is unclear as some accounts describe an almost total rebuild of the church between 1657 and 1662 whereas others suggest that the medieval church largely survived.

    The church was also restored in 1864 to 1865.

    The oldest part of the church is the Norman tympanum which has been dated to 1110-25 (and is now built into the north wall).  Also in the church is an effigy of a cross legged knight which is dated circa 1320.  On the external north wall of the tower is the fragment of an early carving depicting a crowned figure on horseback and inscribed St Edwardus.

    The name of the village derives from the Old English meaning a high place (heah) of gravel, mud or earth (ear) which is bare or lacking in vegetation (calu).

  Name: Holy Trinity, Holdgate
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    At the time of the Domesday book, Stantune was one of a small number of manors in Shropshire with both a church and priest, suggesting there was a Saxon church here.  The parish is now one of the smallest in the diocese.

    The nave and possibly part of the chancel date from the 12th century, with the rest of the chancel and the lower part of the tower from the following century.  The south porch was probably added in the 14th Century and is notable for its carving.  The upper part of the tower dates from the 15th or 17th Century.  The church was restored in 1854 to 1855 and again in 1894 to 1895.

    The pews are box pews, one of which has a desk dated 1707 attached to its back.  Also in the church is a pair of Jacobean seats with carved canopies.  The circular Norman font is elaborately carved with rope moulding, a dragon, interlace, foliage, and medallions.  In the church are royal arms of 1757.  In the south wall of the nave is a tomb recess dating from the 14th century.

    During the Middle Ages, the parish was served by three portionists (priest, deacon and sub-deacon)who formed a secular college, this arrangement survived the Reformation.

    The name of the settlement is Helgot's castle', but the 'castle' has been lost.  Helgot was the name of the tenant in 1086.  In the Domesday Book, the place is called Stantune, from The Old English stan and tun, 'stone farm/settlement'.

  Name: St John the Baptist, Hughley
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 13th Century
  Description: |
    The church was rebuilt in circa 1360, with only the north wall of the 13th Century nave retained from the previous building.

    The bell tower dates from 1701 and the porch is sometime before that.  The church was restored in 1871-2.

    The church has what is considered to be the finest rood screen in Shropshire, which dates from the end of the 15th Century.  It is believed to have been moved to the church from Buildwas Abbey following the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII.  It is thought to have been made in Ludlow.

    There are traces of medieval stained glass in the north and east chancel windows (late 14th Century).

    The oak parish chest is likely medieval.

    To the right of the altar is a corbel, which has the form of a lady’s head. In the south wall is a pillar piscina, something which is not normally seen in Anglican churches. In the floor of the chancel are medieval tiles.  The roof is of note, put in the 1870s the roof is a boarded trussed-rafter roof with bosses.

    The pulpit is Jacobean.

    The church is mentioned in Housman’s A Shropshire Lad.

    The original building was an ancient chapelry of Much Wenlock, and was founded before 1176. It was rebuilt during the 13th and 14th centuries out of limestone rubble and sandstone ashlar dressing, becoming a parish church in its own right during the 16th century.

    Hughley is not mentioned in the Domesday book, but the settlement was held by Wenlock Priory in the hundred of Condover. This original manor was known as Legh or Leye, the name Hugh comes from Sir Hugh de Lega (likely a knight who received land grants) who was first mentioned in circa 1170.

  Name: St John the Baptist, Ightfield
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1490 AD
  Description: |
    Mentioned in the Doomsday book as Istefelt, the name Ightfield may derive from the Old English 'Ihtfeld' (Iht means creature and Feld means field), referring to the fact that the area was rural and farming was prevalent.  Alternatively, it is thought it could dervice from Giht, an ancient British river name.

    The church has 15th Century origins and was partly rebuilt in the 19th Century (although records show a church here dedicated to St John the Baptist in 1072 AD).

  Name: St Luke, Ironbridge
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1837 AD
  Description: |
    The area was originally part of the parish of Madeley, but with the growth of the population due to the bridge, it was thought necessary for Ironbridge to have its own church.

    The position of Ironbridge church is the reverse of the majority of churches, the sanctuary is at the west end and the tower at the east end.  This is because the land at the west end would not bear the weight of a tower.

  Name: St Mary, Jackfield
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1863 AD
  Description: |
    The present church was build in 1863 to replace a chapel (dating from 1759).  The church was designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield and is considered to be the best of the four Shropshire churches he designed.  Blomfield was a prolific architect, and a leading figure in his profession.

    The church has an unusual bell-turret, the style is French Gothic which was in vogue in the 1860s.  The church is most noted for its tiles - there are both Maws and Craven Dunhill tiles in the building.

  Name: St John the Baptist, Kenley
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century
  Description: |
    The date of this church is uncertain, but the nave and chancel probably date from the 12th Century - evidenced by the round headed doorway in the north wall of the nave.

    This church has an unusual low tower whose pyramid roof starts below the ridge of the nave roof.

    The church was restored in 1854 and again in 2016.

    The chancel roof is considered to be an excellent example of a roof with collar-beams on arched braces, with wind-braces laterally.  The roof is thought to be 14th Century.

    The best feature in the church is the pulpit, a Jacobean structure complete with its tester.

    The name of the settlement means in Old English 'Cena's wood/clearing' - Cena is a personal name, and leah is a forest, wood, glade or clearing (and later a pasture or meadow).

  Name: Chapel, Langley
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 14th Century AD
  Description: |
    In 1313 the lords of the manor at Langley (the Burnell's of Actor Burnell) obtained permission to build a chapel at Langley.  The structure of the present building dates from this time.  The chapel was fitted out in about 1546 by the Lee family (to whom the manor of Langley had passed in the second half of the 14th Century).  The chapel was re-roofed in 1601 by the same family.

    By the start of the 18th Century, the chapel had largely fallen out of use, and so avoided the changes being made to churches to re-order interiors to the more elaborate 'high church' model favoured in the 19th Century.  Consequently, it is the set of early 17th Century fittings that makes this chapel significant.

    The last regular service was held at Langley Chapel in 1871.

    The name of the settlement derives from the Old English meaning long wood/clearing - lang (long or tall) and leah (a forest, wood, glade or clearing, and later a pasture or meadow).

  Name: St John the Evangelist, Lawley
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1865 AD
  Description: |
    Lawley was originally a small hamlet, however, the population increased with the discovery of clay and coal just beneath the surface in the 19th Century.  Although within 10 years of the church being built, the coal had been worked out and there was a mass migration away from the area.

    Local farmer Bartholomew Yates engaged with the bishop to requst a church be built, one agrument was that when there was funeral the people had to walk with the coffin to Wellington or Malinslee (four or five miles).

    The church was originally a chapel of ease, built on land donated by the Coalbrookdake Company (the main employer of Lawley's residents) and Lord Forrester.  Much of the building cost was borne by partners of the Coalbrookdale Company.

    The first minister, Thomas Ragg, served from 1865 to 1881.  He was self-educated and was ordained in 1858.

    The church was designed by John Ladds in the Gothic style.  It is of red and yellow brick with stone dressings.  The single bell, made in 1865, was added in 1915.

    Lawley is recorded in the Domesday book, but it was of little value.  The name of the setllement derives from the Old English Lafa's Wood (Lafa is a personal name) and 'leah' is wood or glade.

  Description: |
    The church essentially consists of a Norman nave and Victorian chancel (1884).  The bell openings and porch were also added in 1884.  The nail-studded door is either late medieval or 17th Century.

    The name of the settlement means wood or clearing by the badger’s wooded hill (leah is the Old English for a forest, wood, glade or clearing and later a pasture or meadow and the Old English words brocc and hyrst are badger and wooded hill).

  Name: St Lawrence, Little Wenlock
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The oldest surving part of the church is the Ladty Chapel, which dates from the 12th Century (and the list of incumbents goes back to 1260).  The original nave, which is now the north aisle, is medieval (thought to be 15th Century as the arch-braced roof is typical of this period).  The tower was added in 1667.  The brick nave was added in 1822 and the chancel in 1875.

    In the tower there are five bells, dating from 1704.

    The church contains one of the earliest known cast iron grave slabs in Shropshire - dated 1611, it is set into the floor of the original chancel.  The church is also noted for the 19th Century stained glass commemorating members of the Forester and Edmonds families.

    The communion table is 17th Century.  There is an oak chest from 1733 and the silver communion is dated 1742.

    In 1849 Abraham Darby IV of Coalbrookdale joined the Church of England, having been raised as a Quaker, he was baptised at this church.

    The name Wenlock is thought to be 'white enclosed place'.  The white probably refers to the limestone escarpment of Wenlock Edge.  'Winn' is primitive Welsh for white, and 'loca' is Old English for an enclosure.  'Little' derives from the Latin 'parva' for small.

  Name: St Michael the Archangel, Llanyblodwel
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1847-1853 AD
  Description: |
    The present church was the result of rebuilding the old medieval church in stages between 1847 and 1853 by the then vicar.  The almost detached steeple was designed and added in 1855-6 by the same vicar, he was convinced that the shape would be stronger than the usual hollow spire construction where the thickness of the straight sides diminishes towards the apex.  The height is 104 ft (tower 57 ft and spire 47 ft).

    The place name means 'an enclosure (especially a church or churchyard) by a spring or well which is red (this may refer to a red-leaved tree or red soil)'.

  Name: Talbot Chapel, Longford
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1300 AD
  Description: |
    Originally a medieval church and now a chapel for the Talbot family.

    The chapel was the south aisle / chancel chapel of the medieval church and is now the only remaining part of the church which was demolished in 1803.  The chapel was built around 1300.

    The wall monument is to Thomas and Anne Talbot (who died in 1686 and 1706 respectively).  Thomas Talbot was a relation of the Earl of Shrewsbury.

    The name of the village simply means (in Old English) long ford, possibly referring to a causeway across the river Strine (a tributary of the river Tern).

  Name: St Mary, Longnor
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1275 AD
  Description: |
    Since its construction, the building has hardly been altered.  The western bell turret is 19th Century.

    The interior is noted for its wooden furnishings, some of which date from the 17th Century.

    The building is considered to be a perfect example of Early English architecture, it is considered to be a rarity among English parish churches as the building is entirely a single medieval style.

    The name of the village derives its name from an alder copse on the banks of the river Cound near to the church ('lang' is the Old English for long or tall and 'alor' is the Old English for an alder tree).

  Name: St Michael and All Angels, Loppington
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 14th Century AD
  Description: |
    There was an earlier church at Loppington, as it is known that in 1190 AD the church was given to Wombridge Priory, but no part of the present building dates from the 12th Century.

    The tower is late 15th Century.

    The porch is dated 1658.  The roof is probably also 17th Century.

    In 1643 the church was held by Parliamentarian forces but was subsequently stormed and taken by the Royalists, considerable damage being caused in the process.  It was restored in 1870.

    The pulpit is probably early 18th Century.

    Loppington was recorded in the Domesday Book as Lopitone.

    The meaning of the name of the settlement is uncertain, it may be a farm/settlement (tun) connected with 'Loppa' (a personal name) or 'farm/settlement at the spidery place' (loppe is the Old English for spider).  'Ing' is a connective particle (linking a first element to a final element) in Old English.

  Description: |
    One of the greatest parish churches in England.

    Nothing remains of the original 11th Century church, but 100 years later a second church was built in a style of mixed Norman and early-English.  It is thought that a barrow was removed in 1199 to enlarge the churchyard.

    There was a massive rebuilding of the church between 1433 and 1471, much of which was paid for by the wealthy Palmers' Guild, which endowed a number of chantries in the church.

    There was probably a Saxon church here as Lidum is mentioned in the Doomsday book.  The present church is of medieval origin, but was substantially rebuilt in 1642.

    The churchyard is noted as it has 35 yews shaped by a topiarist.  The church also has an excellent roof.

    The origin of the name Lydham is unknowm, but may be the old English for 'at the gates' or 'at the slopes'.

  Description: |
    Melverley means 'meadow by the mill-ford'.

    The church stands very close to the river Vyrnwy.

    The medieval church was burnt by Owain Glyndwr in 1401.  The present church was built soon after.

    It is noted for being one of just a small number of half timbered churches in the country.  The entire structure is held together with just pegs.  The fact that the wattle and daub is narrower than the timbers shows the early construction of this church using this technique.

    The present building is Victorian, it replaces an 18th Century brick church which itself replaced a medieval church.

    The church is considered to be the best Edward Haycock junior designed church in Shropshire (he is responsible for six other churches in the county).

    The church is noted as it houses one of the best sets of stained glass by Morris and Co in the country.  There are windows by Burne-Jones, Maddox Brown and Morris.  There are also two windows in a different style by Kempe.

    Meole Brace was originally a separate village, the manor of Meole is recorded in the Domesday book.  Meole is the name of the river and Brace is derived from Aldolf de Bracy who held the manor in 1206.

  Name: St Peter, More
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 13th Century AD
  Description: |
    The present building comprises the medieval tower (13th Century), a 17th Century north transept and an early Victorian nave and chancel (rebuilt in 1845).

    Inside the box pews and the hammer beam roof are Victorian.  The west gallery is supported by cast-iron pillars.  Near the font is some Roman mosaic, thought to have been brought from a grand tour rather than being taken from a nearby Roman settlement.

    The north transept was built as the More family mortuary chapel.  There is a connection between the More family and the Mayflower (1620) - citation needed.

    The church formerly housed an important library of early theological books which were given to the parish by Richard More in 1680 (his intent was to teach the minister sound doctrine), the books are now at the nearby Linley Hall.

    In Old English ‘mor’ is a marsh or barren upland, from which the settlement takes its name.

  Name: St Gregory, Morville
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1118 AD
  Description: |
    The church retains almost all of the original Norman features and was constructed within the precincts of a Priory establishment.  This was destroyed in 1540 leaving the church as the parish place of worship.

    The origin of the name of the settlement is uncertain, the generic is 'open land'. Both a river-name and a hill-name, the latter derived from Celtic mamm, 'hill', has been suggested, but there is as yet no satisfactory etymology for this name.

    Note: Have been inside this church, but do not have any interior photos.

  Name: St John the Baptist, Myndtown
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The church may even date back to before the 12th Century.  It is thought to be unique not just within Shropshire, but in the whole of England, in that it has not been the subject of Victorian restoration or alteration.  It is a simple and plain country church.

    The church has two bells, one is 15th Century, and the other is from 1150, making it one of the oldest bells listed in the National Bell Register.

    Some of the roof timbers have been identified as being from trees felled between 1225 and 1250, which makes them some of the oldest in situ church roof timbers.  The original roof was replaced after about 100 years, the timbers in the replacement roof are from trees felled between 1326 and 1348.

    The name Myndtown literally means place or town by the mynd (mountain).  Myndtown was once a significant medieval village.  The village is recorded as 'Munete' in the Domesday book.

  Name: King Charles the Martyr, Newtown
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1869 AD
  Description: |
    After the civil war the villagers of Newtown and other nearby villages desired to have a chapel of ease as the parish church of Wem was too far away.  Initially a private house was used which was consecrated after the Restoration in 1665.  In 1836 this building was demolished and replaced with a brick church.  In 1861 the parish was formed and in 1869 the brick church was replaced with the present stone church.

    The church has an unusual Carillon of 6 bells.

    The pulpit is marble and dates from 1898.

    The elegant wrought-iron screen dates from circa 1870.

    The name of the village simply equates to the Old English new (niwe) and enclosure, farmstead or village (tun).

  Name: All Saints, Norbury
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 13th Century
  Description: |
    The original church was built circa 1200, the tower dates from the late 13th Century / early 14th Century.  The church was substantially rebuilt from 1879 to 1893 (nave 1879-80, chancel 1892-3 and spire 1880).

    The tower has a very distinctive batter (a receding or inward slope) and very thick walls - indicating a degree of defensibility.

    Until 1894 Norbury was a dependent chapelry of Lydbury North.  Also, records from 1521 indicate that the church was dedicated to St Ethelbert.

    The yew tree in the churchyard is believed to be circa 2,700 years old, the tree has a girth of approx. 33ft.

    The name of the village derives from the Old English for northern (nord) and fortified place (burh).  There are hill fort defences near the church.

  Name: St Chad, Norton-in-Hales
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 13th Century AD
  Description: |
    There was an earlier church on the site, but nothing of this building remains.  Of the present church, the chancel was built in the 13th Century and the tower in the 14th Century.  The church was restored in the 19th Century, re-opening in 1865.

    Outside the church is the older font dating from the 12th or 13th Century.

    The arch once connected the church to the rectory, the figure in the niche at the apex  is St Chad in his episcopal cope and mitre.

    The church has an octagonal baptistery (a baptistery is commonly octagonal in plan, a visual metaphor for the number eight, which symbolised a new beginning in Christian numerology).

    The church is notable as it has one of the earliest known commissions by Inigo Jones.  Dating from 1606 and made from Derbyshire alabaster, the commission is a monument to Frances Cotton who died in childbirth.  The monument was later amended to incorporate Sir Rowland Cotton himself who died in 1635. Cotton had various appointments in Shropshire including High Sheriff, member of the Council of the Marches and MP.

    In 1553 the church had three great bells and one Sanctus bell.  Today the church has eight bells.

    The nave is paved of white marble.  The chancel has some Jacobean (1567 to 1625) carving and panelling.  The pulpit is Caen stone and is supported by 16 marble pillars.

    The name Norton in Old English is North farm/settlement.  Hales, in Old English halh meaning 'nooks of land', is an old district name which refers to land on both sides of the Shropshire-Staffordshire border.

  Name: St Michael, Onibury
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century
  Description: |
    The presence of a priest at this place is recorded in the Domesday book, suggesting that there was a pre-Norman church here, althoigh no trace of this remains.

    The earliest feature of the present church is the Norman chancel arch.  The tower is likely to be 14th Century.

    The church was sympathetically restored in 1902 by Detmar Blow with Arts and Crafts fittings.

    There are fragments of medieval wall paintings in the church.

    The Perpendicular (16th Century) pulpit with Jacobean additions is the oldest in Shropshire.

    In the Chancel, there are two 17th Century (1666 and 1673) cast iron grave slabs.

    The name of the settlement means River Onny Fortification (burh is the Old English for a fortified place).  The origin of the name of the river is unknown.

  Name: St Oswald, Oswestry
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 13th Century AD
  Description: |
    In 642 AD Oswald, the King of Northumbria who had previously converted to Christianity was killed by the pagan King Penda of Mercia in the Battle of Oswestry, as a result he rose to martyrdom.  He is thought to have been killed on the site of the church.

    The present church was built in the 13th Century.  Only the lower parts of the tower remain from the original building as the church was heavily damaged in the Civil War (having been used as a lookout tower).  The church was rebuilt in the 17th Century and further restored in the 19th Century.  Most of the windows are Victorian.

    The church has a memorial to the Yale family - a descendant of the figures in the memorial made his fortune in India in the 18th Century and gave his money to a fledgling university in the USA - Yale.

  Name: St George, Pontesbury
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 13th Century
  Description: |
    The church was first recorded in 1254, but it is likely the tower is older as pictures of the original tower show distinct Norman features.  During the middles ages, the church was a collegiate church serving the surrounding area.  Unusually the church was staffed by three portioners, one was a dean, the first was responsible for the first 26 services in the year and the other two the next two lots of 13 each.  This arrangement persisted until 1909.

    Before 1825 the medieval Church consisted of a chancel, nave, north and south aisles and a northern tower.  In 1772 concerns were raised over the stability of the church and in 1810-11 local architects examined the church.  Soon after this the tower collapsed and in 1825 what remained of the nave and aisles were taken down.  The new rebuilt church was opened in 1829, retaining the medieval chancel.

    In 1897 the body of the church was restored.

    The churchyard is circular which usually indicates a very ancient site and there are several large yew trees.

    The font is Norman.  Also of interest is the aumbry door which is dated 1652.

    There was known to be a clock in the tower in 1788.  The present clock was made in Whitchurch by J B Joyce, and was installed in 1858.

    The name of the settlement means 'Pant's fortification' (an old English personal name and burh) but may be, 'River Pant fortification', an old name for the tributary of the River Rea that passes nearby.

  Name: St Martin, Preston Gubbals
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The church was originally built as a chapel of ease in the 12th Century, but later became a parish church. The date of the change to church is unknown, but is likely some time in the 14th or 15th Century.

    In 1866 part of the medieval church was demolished, just the chancel was retained which became the south aisle of a new church.

    The Victorian church was pulled down in 1973, leaving the medieval chancel as the church once again.  The 19th Century arcade was blocked, and now forms the north wall of the remaining building.  A bell from Preston Gubbals is now installed in St Alkmund's Church in Shrewsbury, the bell was cast 1720.

    The sundial in the churchyard was originally a churchyard cross, dated 1638.

    The name of the village in Old English means 'Priests' farm/settlement (tun)'.  It was held in 1086 by a priest name Godebold who was a tenant of St. Alkmund's church in Shrewsbury, the name was corrupted to Gubbals.

  Name: St Laurence, Preston-upon-the-Weald Moors
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1742 AD
  Description: |
    The current church was built between 1739 and 1742 to replace the former church.  The chancel and vestry were added in 1853.

    The name Preston upon the Weald Moors (24 letters) is one of the longest names of any village in England and is thought to have derived from the words 'Priests' farm/settlement' on the 'wild moors' indicating that the village may well have ecclesiastical origins.

  Name: St George, Rodington
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1851 AD
  Description: |
    The domesday book mentions the presence of both a priest and a church at this place.  The medieval church is long gone however, a Georgian church built at this site in 1751 and this was in turn replaced with the present Victorian church.

    In 1929, a section of wall of the medieval church was discovered.

    The place name Rodington is derived from name of the river (Roden), the origin of which is unknown, and the Old English 'tun' meaning farm or settlement.

  Name: St Mary, Selattyn
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1291 AD 
  Description: |
    The village is close to Offa's Dyke and the dyke bounds the parish on the west, the name derives from sulh and tun which means in Old English a plough(-land) farm/settlement, or perhaps, a gully farm/settlement and has also been modified by Welsh influence.

    The churchyard has a number of very old yew trees, suggesting that the site has been a place of Christian worship for over 1000 years.  However, the church itself is first mentioned in the Papal Tax records in 1291.  The church is noted for its 13th Century font and the barrel roof over the chancel, which is thought to be from the 14th Century.  The north and south transepts were added in 1821-28.  The church was extensively rebuilt in 1891-92.

  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1854 AD
  Description: |
    Although medieval in origin, the church was partly rebuilt in the 1660s and then nearly the whole church was rebuilt in 1854.  The church is noted for the half-timbered belfry which juts out above the west wall.

    The name of the village derives from the Saxon 'shena' and 'tun' meaning beautiful place or farm/settlement.

  Name: All Saints, Shelve
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 1839 AD
  Description: |
    The present church was built to replace a medieval structure and is built in the Early English style.  The church contains items from the former church, specifically the rood-beam above the sanctuary, the nine-sided font (which may be Norman) and some 17th Century panelling.

    This church is one of the highest in the county at 1,150 feet above sea level.

    The place name likely derives from the fact it is situated on an area of relatively flat ground in an otherwise undulating terrain, as in 'shelf' of level ground.

  Name: St Alkmund, Shrewsbury
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1475 AD
  Description: |
    St Alkmund died circa 802 AD, he was the younger son of Alhred (king of Northumbria) at Lilleshall, his relics were removed to the collegiate church dedicated to him at Derby.  This church in Shrewsbury was also founded as a collegiate church in 912 AD by Aethelflaed, daughter of Alfred the Great, king of Mercia.  By the time of the Domesday survey, the church was substantially endowed.  However, when Lilleshall Abbey was established in 1148 AD, the church became an poor vicarage as property was transferred to Lilleshall.

    The church stands at the highest point in the town.

    The original medieval church is thought to have been a very fine example.  However, following the collapse of Old St Chad's in 1788, there was concern about the safety of the church.  An act of Parliament decreed the demolition and rebuilding of all but the tower.

    The present tower and spire were built around 1475 AD.  The rest of the present church is Georgian.

  Name: St Peter, Stanton Lacy
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: Circa 1050 AD
  Description: |
    The church is one the few mentioned in the Domesday book.

    The settlement, known as Stantone at the time of Domesday book, was a prosperous place.  It was part Robert de Lacy’s land and was held by Siward (an important Earl of northern England in the 11th Century).  Consequently, Stantone had a substantial Saxon church.

    The present building retains some elements of the original Saxon church, and the church was added to in the 13th Century (when the chancel was enlarged) and the 14th Century (when the tower and south transept and aisle were added).

    On the exterior walls are thin pilaster strips (also known as leseners), these are typical of Anglo- Saxon work - the walls between these strips were originally covered by a layer of plaster, but this had been deliberately removed by 1846.  The original Saxon doorway is still present in the north wall.  There are also two sets of canopied tomb recesses in the exterior walls.

    The font dates from the 14th Century.  The stained glass is Victorian.  The organ was installed in 1854 and the pulpit was installed in 1849.

    The Altar and Reredos were installed in 1849, and were originally unpainted.  They are of Caen stone (from north-western France) and were painted in 1930.  The Sanctuary floor is tiled with Ironbridge (Jackfield?) encaustic tiles, with designs by Minton.

    There is an odd feature in the north wall of the nave, its exact purpose is unknown but it was thought to be an Aumbry (a cupboard in the wall, usually in the Sanctuary for holding the Sacraments).  The carved oak is a recent addition (a similar serpent design can be found in Worcester Cathedral).

    The name Stanton means stone farm/settlement (stan is the Old English for a stone or rock) and tun is the Old English for an enclosure, a farmstead, a village or an estate.  Lacy is a family name.

  Name: St Michael, Stanton Long
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    In the Domesday Book, the place is called Stantune, the same as Holdgate.  Stanton Long is likely to have separated from the neighbouring parish of Holdgate some time in the 12th Century.  Alterations later in the 13th Century and the beginning of the 14th Century included new windows in the nave, partly to light a new side chapel, and rebuilding the south chancel wall, which incorporates a piscina and tomb recess.

    The roof is late medieval.  The belfry and porch were added in the 16th or 17th Century.  The church was partly restored in 1842, and further restoration was done in 1869 to 1871.

    The south porch has some ancient timbers at the entrance, and the side walls are Victorian.  The south door is dated circa 1200.  The chancel arch is Victorian.  There are two piscinae, one in the chancel and one in the south wall of the nave.

    The stone reredos is unusual, constructed in 1888 and designed by F R Kempson of Hereford.

    The name of the settlement derives from the Old English for a stone or rock (stan) and a farmstead or village (tun) and long or tall (lang).

The tower is 13th Century with a late 14th Century belfry.  The porch is dated 1593.  The east end of the chancel was rebuilt in 1740 and the church was restored in 1891 - 1892.

    The church has very large stepped diagonal west buttresses, one has a datestone recording named churchwardens amongst other things.

    The churchyard is circular and notably raised above the surrounding area.  This is thought to be an early Irish / Welsh tradition which influenced churches in later centuries, there are a few other examples of this in Shropshire.

    The name Stanton means stone farm or settlement in Old English (stan is a stone or rock and tun is a farmstead or settlement).  The suffix means either servant's heath or monastic community's heath.

  Name: St John the Baptist, Stapleton
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    Stapleton is an ancient manor recorded in the Domesday book as Hundeslit (from the personal name Hund and the Old English for hill-side.  The present name is derived from steep-place farm/settlement (stepel and tun).

    The present church was built in the 12th Century and for reasons unknown it was originally a two storey building, a possibly unique feature amongst churches.  The second storey was built on top of the very thick walls of a Saxon or Early Norman church.  The church was on the upper floor and the ground floor is assumed to have been an undercroft.

    The tower was added in 1832, it is unknown when the two storey were converted into one - the result is a tall church with two tiers of windows.

    The church organ is among the top six hundred in the country and there is a small tapestry piece in the nave said to have been worked by Mary, Queen of Scots.

  Name: St Chad, Stockton
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century
  Description: |
    This church has 12th Century origins.  The lower part of the tower is Perpendicular (perhaps 14th Century) and the upper part dates from early 17th Century.  The church was heavily restored in 1858-8 at the expense of TC Whitmore of Apley Park, when th eold walls of the nave and chancel were refaced both on the inside and the outside.  Internally, the roofs are notable, there is a wagon-roof in the nave (which may include some Jacobean timbers) and a panelled oak ceiling in the chancel.

    The place name probably derives from the old English for 'farm/settlement associated with an outlying farm/settlement', as 'stoc' is the old English for a place or secondary settlement and 'tun' is the old English for a farmstead or settlement.

  Name: St Mary, Sutton Maddock
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1579 AD
  Description: |
    At the time of the Domesday survey, the settlement was known as Sudtone (south town) as it was the southern part of the Saxon Parish of Iteshale (Shifnal).

    The "Maddock" was added in the 13th century when Sutton was granted to Iorwerth Goch (son of the ruler of Powis) for interpreter services between England and Wales in the reign of  Henry II.  Maddock was Iorwerth's son.

    The oldest part of the present building is the tower (dated 1579, Tudor, although the earlier part may be Perpendicular).  The rest of the church dates from 1888 when it was rebuilt.

    There was a previous Georgian building,  which has been completely replaced.  The parish register dates from 1559 and the chalice and patten are dated 1662.

    The name of village means south farm / settlement (Sutton) in Old English and Madoc is the name the family which held the manor in the 12th and 13th Centuries.

  Name: St Bartholomew, Tong
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1410 AD
  Description: |
    Sometimes referred to as the 'Westminster Abbey of the Midlands'; the church is noted for its architecture which includes a fan vaulted side chapel (which is rare in Shropshire) and its numerous tombs.

    The church was founded by the widowed Isabel Lingen as a chantry and collegiate church.  The commission to dissolve the college was issued on 17th September 1546 and referred to the legislation that permitted the king's commissioners to seize property on his behalf.

    The church is a cruciform building (rare for the Perpendicular era) and is built of red sandstone (which is abundant locally).  The church is noted for its bourdon bell which weighs over 2 tonnes and is called the Great Bell of Tong - claimed to be the loudest and biggest bell in Shropshire.  It had been feared that the tower would not support continued tolling, so it is rung only on certain days / occasions which gives the vicar of the church an equal status with the local noble families and the sitting monarch.

    The name Tong is derived from the old English 'tweonga' meaning a pinched piece or a spit of land, in this case, it describes the situation of the village between the two headstreams of the River Worfe.

  Name: St Lucy, Upton Magna
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    Magna is Latin, meaning 'great', so the translation of Upton Magna is 'Great Upton'.  Upton derives from the old English for a settlement on higher ground.

    The nave and chancel are originally Norman, as is the south doorway of the Nave.  Some original masonry survives in the chancel but the church was substantially rebuilt and enriched by the architect G E Street (best known as the designer of the Royal Courts of Justice) in the 1850s and 1860s.  The tower is Perpendicular (the final phase of Gothic architecture, which spanned the late 14th Century to the early 16th Century).

    Inside the church are several medieval wall paintings.

    One of the bells in notable as it is quite rare, it is one of only 37 (approx.)cast at a foundry in Exeter in circa 1475 to 1499.

    This church is the only one in Shropshire dedicated to St Lucy (a Christian martyr who died during the Diocletianic Persecution - the last and most severe persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire).

  Name: All Saints, Wellington
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1789-1790 AD
  Description: |
    The present church was built to replace a medieval one which was damaged during the Civil War.  The church was designed by George Steuart who was also responsible for St Chad's in Shrewsbury - All Saints being built a little earlier and is less impressive than St Chad's.  No extensions have been added, but the interior has been modified on a number of occasions.

    This was the first Shropshire church to introduce an entrance front in the form of a monumental classical temple portico.  The building is made of Grinshill stone with a slate roof.

    There is mention of a priest at the site in the Domesday book.  The origin of the name of the town is uncertain, but is likely to mean farm or settlement of a Saxon settler - Weola.
    Note: Have been inside this church, but do not have any interior photos.

  Name: St Michael and All Angels, Welshampton
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1860s AD
  Description: |
    The present church was preceeded by a Saxon or Norman church, a medieval building dating from 1391 and church built in 1788 which became inadequate for the needs of the parish and fell into disrepair.  In 1861 a new building was commissioned from the leading architect of the day Sir George Gilbert Scott.  The walls are of yellow sandstone ashlar; the church has a slate roof which has a lozenge pattern over the nave and a zig-zag pattern over the chancel.

    Welshampton is recorded in the Domesday book as Hantone, meaning high farm or settlement.  The prefix 'Welsh' is a reflection of its proximity to Flintshire.

    An African prince is buried in the churchyard - the then vicar was as offered a post in Lesotho, which he turned down but maintained contact with the country.  The prince came to England to train as a priest and visited Welshampton when the new church was consecrated in 1863, but during the visit he caught a fever and died and so was buried at the church.

  Name: St Michael and All Angels, Wentnor
  Diocese: Hereford
  Date: Norman (1095 AD or earlier)
  Description: |
    The original church was Norman and there are a few surviving elements of this church in the present building.  The advowson (the right of presentation of a candidate to a benefice or church office) of the church was presented to the Abbey of Shrewsbury as early as 1095.  Much of the church was rebuilt in 1886.

    The church has a notable tombstone (the so called Hurricane Tombstone) inside by the font under the tower, it commemorates a hurricane and snow storm which claimed the lives of seven villagers from the nearby hamlet of Asterton in 1772.

    In the Domesday book, Wentnor is listed as Wantenovre.  The name of the village means Wonta's or Wenta's (personal name) flat-topped ridge (Old English ofer).

  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1712 AD

  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 1874 AD
  Description: |
    The church was completely rebuilt in 1874 by G E Street, the present building replacing one that had been in existence since at least medieval times.  The earlier church was built as a chapel to the nearby church at Upton Magna.

    A branch of the Shropshire Union canal ran along the south of the site, this was de-watered in the 1960’s.

    The tower houses two bells from the 13th and 14th Centuries in a frame of circa 1800.  Some internal elements of the original church survive - the stone reredos depicting the crucifixion, the stone font, stone pulpit, chancel wall and the eagle lectern.

    The church is noted for its 16th Century brasses.

    The chancel has a trussed rafter roof with a collar beam added and the nave has a collar roof over.

  Name: St Peter, Wrockwardine
  Diocese: Lichfield
  Date: 12th Century AD
  Description: |
    The church is mentioned in the Domesday book and so is thought to be of Saxon origin.  The current church is of Norman origin (with modifiications being made in the 14th Century).
