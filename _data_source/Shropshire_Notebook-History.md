Britain is cut off from continental Europe by the English Channel.

# Header: Bronze Age - c. 2500 BC to 800 BC

Remains of Bronze Age settlements are not common in Britain and none have been recorded in Shropshire so far.  It is believed that many tribes led a nomadic lifestyle based on cattle and agriculture so did not build structures to last (communities were often based near rivers for transport).  There is evidence, however, of tree clearing at this time to make space for crops.

Tumuli (burial mounds) were built during this time on areas of high ground.  As well as providing a place to inter the cremated remains of their dead, the tumuli may also be where a tribe gathered at certain times of the year for religious purposes.  There are three known stone circles in Shropshire that date from this time at: Mitchell's Fold, Hoarstones and Whetstones (now destroyed).

# Name: Mitchell's Fold
- Date: Bronze Age

Sometimes called Medgel's Fold or Madges Pinfold, Mitchell's Fold is a Bronze Age stone circle.  Its true history is unknown.  This is one of three known stone circles in Shropshire.

# Header: Iron Age - c. 800 BC to 43 AD

c. 500 BC - Celts inhabit much of Europe, and begin to colonize the British Isles.

The area now known as Shropshire was part of the territory of the Celtic Cornovii tribe (they also occupied the areas now known as Cheshire, Staffordshire north Herefordshire and parts of the eastern areas of Wales - areas now known Flintshire, Powys and Wrexham).

The capital of the tribe was most probably the Wrekin hill fort.  The first mention of the tribe occurs in the works of Ptolemy in the 2nd Century AD.  The origin of the name Cornovii is unknown, but it may mean 'People of the Horn' referring to a horned god cult followed by the tribe.

# Name: Old Oswestry Hill Fort
- Date: Iron Age

One of Britain's most spectacular and impressive early Iron Age hill forts.

The complexity of the defences suggests several phases of development.  After the hill fort was abandoned it was incorporated into Wat's Dyke (built by the king of Mercia in the early 8th Century, it preceded the better-known Offa's Dyke).

# Header: Roman Invasion of Britain Begins - 43 AD

During the Roman occupation the tribe was reorganised as a Roman civitas (a social body of the cives, or citizens, united by law) and the capital was relocated to Viroconium.

# Name: Viroconium Cornoviorum
- Date: 55 AD

The site was first established in about AD 55 as a frontier post as it was strategically located near the end of the Watling Street Roman trunk road which ran across England from Dubris (Dover).  It was the fourth largest city in Roman Britain.

The site was abandoned around 88 AD as a fortress and was taken over as a civilian settlement and continued to be inhabited until the 7th century.

The ruin is noted for the 'the Old Work' (an archway, part of the baths' frigidarium and the largest free-standing Roman ruin in Britain).

# Header: Post-Roman Britain - 410 to c. 450 AD

In 407 the Roman troops in Britain are sent across the Channel into Gaul to defend that part of the Empire against the threats from the east.  This left Britain without any protection, the Saxons took advantage and raided in 408 and 409 AD.  Requests for aid were rejected by the Emporer in Rome, and so the Romano-Britains expelled the Roman officials.

Roman civic life continued, but declined (as the cities had lost their central function as centres for taxation and administration) and by about 450 AD the Roman econmic system had broken down.

# Header: Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain Begins - c. 450 AD

England is subject to successive invasions of Germanic tribesmen (Angles, Saxons and Jutes).  Originally settling in eastern England, they moved progressively west as more arrived.

Following the collapse of the Romano-British administration, the Cornovii territory may have become part of the Kingdom of Powys, but little is known about this period in respect of the area now known as Shropshire.

It is possible that the area of Shrewsbury was first settled in the 5th Century by refugees from Wroxeter.  Also, it is possible that the king of Powys moved his court to the same area to resist the encroaching Anglian advances.

# Header: Integration with Mercia

Pengwern - Citation needed

It is likely that the Cornovii territory was partitioned and ruled by different princes, probably perpetuated in the ancient boundaries between the dioceses of Lichfield and Hereford.

Eventually, the northern part of Shropshire was part of the Anglo-Saxon territory of Wreocensaete (sometimes anglicised to Wrekinsets, the name approximates to Wrekin-dwellers) and the southern part of Shropshire probably belonged to the Magonsaete (a minor sub-kingdom of the greater Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia).

The northern and southern parts of Shropshire were absorbed into the Saxon kingdom of Mercia by King Offa (Offa ruled Mercia from 757 to 796).  In 765 AD he constructed Watt's Dyke to defend his territory against the Welsh, and in 779 AD, having pushed across the River Severn, drove the Welsh King of Powys from Shrewsbury, he secured his conquests by a second defensive earthwork known as Offa's Dyke.

The name "Mercia" is Old English for "boundary folk".

Shrewsbury was probably founded as a town in the 8th Century by the Saxon rulers of Mercia, who needed a fortified burh to control the Severn river-crossing on the road between the burhs of Hereford and Chester.

# Name: St Oswald's Well, Oswestry
- Date: 641 AD or 642 AD

The Battle of Maserfield (or Maserfeld, "marsh (border) field"; Welsh: Maes Cogwy), was fought on 5 August 641 or 642, between the Anglo-Saxon kings Oswald of Northumbria and Penda of Mercia, ending in Oswald's defeat, death, and dismemberment.

# Header: Mercia Converts to Christianity - Latter Part of the 7th Century

The first kings of Mercia were pagans, and they resisted the encroachment of Christianity longer than other kingdoms in the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy.

Mercian rulers remained resolutely pagan until the reign of Peada in 656. The first appearance of Christianity in Mercia, however, had come at least thirty years earlier, following the Battle of Cirencester of 628, when Penda incorporated the formerly West Saxon territories of Hwicce into his kingdom, but Penda remained Pagan until his death.  Penda respected the Christians and even allowed them to operate more widely in Mercia.  However, not much progress was made in converting the nobles and people of Mercia.

The diocese of Mercia was founded 656 by Diuma (the first Bishop of Mercia).

In 669 AD, the King of Mercia, Wulfhere, had requested a new bishop, as Mercia was without one following the death of the previous incumbent, Chad was dispatched by the Archbishop.  And so, after an inconclusive start, decisive steps to Christianise Mercia were being taken; Chad was the fifth bishop to minister to the Mercians and is credited with introducing Christianity to the Mercian kingdom.  Wulfhere gave Chad land to build a monasterary at Lichfield.

However, Mercia did not survive long as an ecclesiastical entity.  From 676 AD the Archbishop adopted a policy of appointing bishops to much smaller tribal groups within the kingdoms, thus covering smaller areas—closer in size to those found in other West European countries.  Hence, a bishopric (diocese) was established at Hereford for the Magonsæte sub-kingdom (and the existing Lichfield diocese covered Wreocansaete).

# Name: Wenlock Priory
- Date: c. 680 AD

The original Anglo-Saxon monastery was founded by the then King of Magonsaete (king Merewalh), his daughter quickly became its abbess (she was later canonised).  Wenlock Priory was the first monastery to be founded in Shropshire.

After Milburga's death circa 727 little is known of the monastery until the Norman conquest.

# Quote: County Day

Shropshire's county day is the 23rd February which is the feast day of St Milburga abbess of Wenlock Priory.

# Name: Offa's Dyke
- Date: Late 8th Century AD

In the late 8th Century, Offa's Dyke is constructed to delineate the border between Anglian Mercia and the Welsh Kingdom of Powys (it did not represent a mutually agreed boundary, rather it is believed to be a defensive earthwork or was built to demonstrate the power and intent of the Mercians).

# Header: Danelaw is Established - 878 AD

The Vikings had been raiding Britain since 792 AD, but being so far west, this had little impact on Shropshire until Danelaw was established.

Danelaw is established in 878 AD which divides Britain into the Anglo-Saxon south and the Danish north.

Although not part of the Danelaw, the area that is now known as Shropshire was regularly overrun by Danish raiders, as the eastern part of Mercia had been seized by the Danes.

The final Mercian king died in 879.  From about 883 to 911 AD Mercia was ruled by a Mercian Lord under the overlorship of Wessex.  Thus, the Kingdom of Mercia appears to have lost its political independence and was ruled by the kings of Wessex.  The last reference to Mercia by name is in the annal for 1017 AD, when Eadric Streona was awarded the government of Mercia by Cnut.  The Mercians as a people are last mentioned in the annal for 1049 AD.

# Header: Norman Conquest - 1066 AD

The Norman conquest of Britain and start of Early Middle Ages (Medieval England).

After the Norman Conquest the principal estates of Shropshire were all bestowed on Norman proprietors, pre-eminent among whom is Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury.

Many new towns are established in the period from the Norman Conquest to the mid-13th Century and are a result of deliberate plantation.

# Name: Shrewsbury Castle
- Date: 1070 AD

Built by Roger de Montgomery as a defensive fortification for the town.  The town walls (of which little now remain) surrounded the town from castle.

Little of the original structure remains.  The castle was extensively repaired in 1643 during the Civil War before being acquired by Sir Francis Newport in 1663.  The castle was further repaired by Thomas Telford in 1780 on behalf of Sir William Pulteney.
![](../1shropshire/assets/images/history/2018-07-14_12_32_05_DSC_2787_DxO.jpg)

# Name: Ludlow Castle
- Date: 1075 AD

The castle is believed to have been founded by Walter de Lacy after the Norman Conquest and was one of the first stone castles to be built in England.

During the 12th and 13th Centuries the castle changed hands many times.  The Duke of York inherited the castle in 1425 and it was a symbol of Yorkist authority during the Wars of the Roses.  Then in 1461 ownership passed to the crown.

The castle was chosen as the seat of the Council in the Marches of Wales and so was effectively the capital of Wales.  Consequently, the castle was renovated throughout the 16th Century.

With the castle being besieged and taken by Parliamentary forces during the English Civil War and following the abolition of the Council in 1689 (after it had been restored following the English Civil War), the castle fell into neglect.

# Name: Shrewsbury Abbey
- Date: 1083 AD

The Abbey was founded in 1083 as a Benedictine monastery by the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, Roger de Montgomery (who received Shropshire from William the Conqueror in 1071). It grew to be one of the most important and influential abbeys in England, and an important centre of pilgrimage.

Also known as the abbey church of St Peter and St Paul.

The abbey was one of the last to surrender (being at the end of the commissioners circuit) and was dissolved on 24th January 1540.

# Name: Oswestry Castle
- Date: 1086 AD

The first reference to this castle is in 1086 - the recording of castelle Lurve in the Domesday book as being built by the then Sheriff of Shropshire in the Hundred of Meresberie.

No town was recorded until 1272, although the Welsh were referring to Croes Oswald in 1254.

The castle was fought over and changed ownership many times during the conflict between the English and the Welsh.  By 1270 the castle's walls had been extended to encircle the town, but by this time the castle's military significance was in decline.

The castle was the scene of a parliament held by Richard II in 1398.

The castle was captured by Oliver Cromwell's troops in 1644, and by 1650 it had largely been demolished by the Roundheads.

# Name: Wenlock Priory
- Date: Late 11th Century AD

Wenlock was re-founded by the Normans as a priory of Cluniac monks in the late 11th Century by Roger de Montgomery. In 1101 it is reputed that Milburga's relics were discovered, attracting pilgrims and prosperity to the the priory allowing the impressive medieval priory to be built (which reflects the Cluniac love of elaborate decoration).

# Header: The Church - 11th & 12th Century AD

Many churches are built in the 11th and 12th Centuries - the church was massively endowed and its role all pervasive in medieval society.

Churches are listed on a separate page.

# Name: Bridgnorth Castle
- Date: 1101 AD

Founded in 1101 by Robert de Belleme (the second Earl of Shrewsbury, succeeding after his father Roger de Montgomery).

The main feature of the castle is the great square tower, built during the reign of Henry II.

During the English Civil War, Bridgnorth was one of the Midlands' main Royalist strongholds.  But following a three week siege Cromwell's Roundheads took Bridgnorth - Cromwell ordered that the castle be demolished and by 1647 little of the structure remained.  As a result, the remaining parts of the great tower now lean at an angle of 15 degrees (four times the lean of the tower at Pisa).

# Name: Buildwas Abbey
- Date: 1135 AD

A Cistercian monastery founded by a local bishop.  Sparse at the outset, the abbey did undergo several periods of growth and increasing wealth.  The abbey was a centre of learning and had a substantial library.  In the early days it was also noted fits its discipline.  The abbey was suppressed in 1536 as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

# Name: Lilleshall Abbey
- Date: 1145-1148 AD

The Abbey was founded around 1148 AD for a community of what is thought to be about 13 Augustinian canons from Dorchester Abbey in Oxfordshire.

During the 13th Century, the Abbey enjoyed great wealth and prestige - a respectable income was derived from a variety of sources, including even the tolls for the use of the Atcham Bridge.  The then king (Henry III) was entertained at the Abbey twice in about 1240 AD.

The Abbey suffered financial problems in the 14th Century (the abbott was accused of mismanagement).

The Abbey was closed in 1538, as part of the Suppression of the Monasteries.  The site then became a private dwelling until the mid-17th Century.

During the Civil War, the former Abbey buildings were severely damaged by Parliamentarian troops, at which point the site was abandoned and left to decay.
![](../1shropshire/assets/images/history/photo-needed.jpg)

# Name: White Ladies Priory
- Date: 1186 AD

A priory of Augustinian canonesses who wore habits of undyed cloth.

Unusually for a monastic site, the buildings appear to be largely unaltered from the original.  The priory was never a large or wealthy house.

It was one of the first religious houses to be suppressed in 1535, after which most of the buildings were taken down and the site passed through various owners.

# Header: The Marcher Lordships Emerge - 12th Century AD

During the 12th Century the Marcher lordships emerged as almost independent states between the Welsh and English authorities.  The Marcher families were granted privileges by the English Crown which led to the exclusion of the judicial authority of the monarch and the Sheriff from their domains.

# Name: Clun Castle
- Date: 12th Century AD

Established by Robert de Say after the Norman invasion, Clun Castle was an important Marcher lord castle in the 12th Century.

Clun played a key part in protecting the region from Welsh attack, but the family (Fitzalan) gradually abandoned it as a property in favour of their more luxurious castle at Arundel.  The family converted the castle into a hunting lodge in the 14th Century, but by the 16th Century the castle was largely ruined.

# Name: Haughmond Abbey
- Date: 12th Century AD

Haughmond was an Augustinian monastery and was closely associated with the FitzAlan family (who became Earls of Arundel).

It was a successful and wealthy abbey.

The commission to dissolve the abbey was issued from Woodstock Palace on 23 August 1539 and signed by Thomas Cromwell.  A deed of surrender was drawn up on 19 September.  By 16 October, the abbot, the prior and 9 canons had signed to acknowledge Henry VIII as supreme over the Church of England.

The site was sold, some buildings were used as a private residence, others were plundered for building stone.  During the Civil War, fire further destroyed the site and it was turned over for use as a farm.

# Name: Moreton Corbet Castle
- Date: Circa 1200 AD

Originally known as Moreton Toret Castle, the stone structure was constructed to replace the probable fortified structure inhabited by Anglo Saxon thegns.  The name was changed to Moreton Corbet when Richard de Corbet inherited the castle in 1235.

The castle saw action in the English Civil War when it is known to have changed hands at least four times.

# Name: Whittington Castle
- Date: 13th Century AD

The original castle was captured and destroyed by the King of Gwynedd in 1223 - after being returned to the English under the peace treaty it was rebuilt in stone, but was then ceded to the Welsh in 1267.  The castle remained in Welsh possession until 1276 when the castle became the residence of a powerful Marcher lord family.

# Name: Infirmary, Tong
- Date: mid-13th Century AD

The infirmary was constructed by the then owner of Tong castle as part remedy for a fine imposed on his father who rebelled against King John.  When the church and college was built in the 15th Century, the infirmary was incorporated into the college and enabled 13 alms people to be housed and looked after by the college priests.  After the Dissolution the infirmary remained as an Alms House, they were later demolished in 1764.

# Name: Hopton Castle
- Date: 1260s AD

It is believed that the castle was founded in the 12th century as a motte and bailey castle by one of the de Optons as a mesne lord of the Says of Clun Castle.  The family was politically significant, Sir Walter de Opton being Sheriff of the large, adjacent counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire.

It is most probable that Walter de Opton (over time becoming de Hopton) built the stone castle during the Barons' War of the 1260s.  The bailey was fortified in stone and the rectangular two-storey keep was built.

The last Walter Hopton died during the Wars of the Roses in the 15th century and the castle passed by marriage to the Corbet family of Moreton Corbet castle.

# Name: Cruck Cottage, Upton Magna
- Date: 1269 AD

This cottage is thought to be the oldest still-standing cruck cottage in England (and one of the oldest still-standing cruck cottages in Europe).  The Historic England listing suggests that the cottage dates from the 15th or 16th Century (and building does appear to have been remodelled in the 15th century), but dendrochronological tests on the crucks in the cottage have dated the timber to 1269.

# Name: Acton Burnell Castle
- Date: 1284 AD

Built in 1284 by Richard Burnell, Bishop of Bath and Wells, Acton Burnell Castle is a fortified manor house three storeys high which comprised hall, solar, bedrooms, offices, chapel and kitchen.  A benefit only extended to trusted people, Burnell as a friend and advisor to King Edward I, was granted a royal licence to crenellate and fortify the manor.

In the Autumn of 1283, it is believed that Edward I held a Parliament at Acton Burnell - this is significant because it was the first time in English history that the law making process included the Commons.  The law passed became known as the Statute of Acton Burnell, a law giving protection to creditors, indicating the increasing significance of traders during those times.

# Name: Stokesay Castle
- Date: 1280s AD

One of the first fortified manor houses in England, Stokesay Castle was built by Laurence of Ludlow.  It was built on the site of an earlier castle, some of which still survives.  Laurence of Ludlow was one of the leading wool merchants in England.

The gatehouse was added in 1640-1641, just before the English Civil War.  At that time Stokesay was owned by William Craven, the first Earl of Craven and supporter of the king.  The Royalist war effort collapsed in 1645, the castle was besieged and the Royalist garrison was forced to surrender.  The castle was ordered to be slighted by Parliament, but only minor damage was done allowing it to continue as a residence.

# Name: The Abbot's House, Shrewsbury
- Date: 1459 AD

A remarkably complete and significant surviving example of a late medieval town house.  It was built by the Abbot of Lilleshall as an investment for his abbey.  The trees used for the wooden frame were cut down in 1457-8.  Town bailiffs and the abbot's carpenter are mentioned in records as attending a frame raising ceremony in 1459. The ground floor was all shops.  The upper floors were tenements for people to live in.

# Name: Much Wenlock Guildhall
- Date: 1540 AD

Although Much Wenlock received a charter from the King in 1468, local order was in the hands of the powerful Abbot of Wenlock Priory.  The Guildhall was built to provide a court (which remained in use until 1985) when the Priory was dissolved.  A Council Chamber was added in 1577.

The chambers are furnished with carved oak panels from a local manor house (installed in 1848) - no one knows which manor house or how they were available.

# Name: Lavington's Hole, Bridgnorth
- Date: 1646 AD

On 31st March 1646 during the Civil War, Bridgnorth was under siege from Parliamentary forces - the Royalists retreated to the castle after setting fire to the stables in Listley Street.  The fire soon spread to burn down many buildings in High Town.  It was the incendiary torches fired from the castle that ignited St. Leonards Church, burning all the town records that were stored in the church.  By 1st April 1646 most of Bridgnorth High Town was destroyed by the great fire.

After three weeks of continued attack on the castle Colonel Lavington took charge of getting a team of Parliamentary forces to dig a 70 foot tunnel under Castle Hill.  Knowing that the Royalists stored their gunpowder in St Marys Church, his aim was to blow up the church.

69 feet of tunnel was dug into the rock face but was not completed as the Royalists surrendered on Sunday 26th April 1646.

# Name: Pitchford Treehouse
- Date: 1692 AD

The treehouse is thought to be the oldest in the world, it is of circa 17th Century origin (first mentioned in 1692). It was given a new image in 1760 and was renovated again in 1980.  It is situated in a large leaved lime tree (Tilia Platyphyllos) and is constructed in the same style as the hall.

A part glazed door opens into the tree house to reveal a carved moulded cornice ceiling, stripped oak floor and gothic windows on all sides.  There is evidence that the restoration in 1760 may have been the work of the Shropshire architect Thomas Farnolls Pritchard.

Queen Victoria recorded in her diary that she watched a visiting pack of foxhounds from the treehouse during her visit to Pitchford Hall as a young princess.

# Name: Shrewsbury Prison
- Date: 1793 AD

The original building was constructed by Thomas Telford to plans by a Shrewsbury architect.  The gatehouse is one of the few original features remaining, as in 1877 the prison was handed to the control of central governance and much of the prison was modernised and reconstructed as a result.

The name The Dana is still often used for the prison - the Dana Gaol was a medieval prison close to the site of the current establishment.

The bust of prison reformer John Howard is above the main entrance to the prison (Howard consulted on the construction of the prison).

The prison is famous for the high number of hangings that took place on its grounds - these took place from 1795 (the crime - theft of 10 handkerchiefs) to 1961 (the crime - robbery and murder).

# Name: William Penny Brookes Born
- Date: 1809 AD

William Penny Brookes was an English surgeon, magistrate, botanist, and educationalist.  He established the Olympian Class of his Wenlock Agricultural Reading Society in 1850 to inspire local people to keep fit and take part in sports competitions.  Following the 1860 games, the Olympian Class was set up as the independent Wenlock Olympian Society.

Brookes' campaign for physical education brought him into contact with Baron Pierre de Coubertin - in 1890, the young French aristocrat visited Much Wenlock and stayed with Dr Brookes at his lifelong home in Wilmore Street.  Coubertin was inspired by discussions with Brookes and a games staged for his visit - in 1894 Coubertin set up the International Olympic Committee.

Consequently, Dr Brookes is credited as a founding father of the modern Olympic Games, and one of the Olympic mascots for London 2012 was named Wenlock after the town.

# Name: Weir Built in the Shrewsbury Loop (the Middle Severn)
- Date: 1909 AD

The weir at Shrewsbury was built in 1909 to keep the water level at a depth suitable for pleasure boats around the loop.
