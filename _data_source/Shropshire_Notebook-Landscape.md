# Name: The Hollies

The Hollies nature reserve (at The Stiperstones above Snailbeach).  The reserve is a scattered grove of ancient holly trees, some of the trees are 300 or 400 years old.

Rowan trees can also be seen growing next to the holly trees, in some cases the rowan trees are rooted inside the holly trees.  This is because birds such as redwings, fieldfares and winter thrushes eat the rowan berries and then deposit the seeds when perched on the holly trees.
