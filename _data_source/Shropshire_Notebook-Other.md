# Name: The Railway, Broseley

Broseley developed as an industrial area due to the abundance of coal, clay, iron ore and limestone easily workable in one area, also the woods provided charcoal and the River Severn transport.  In fact, the mines in Broseley and the adjoining parish of Benthall became of national importance in the seventeenth century.

This industrialisation drove innovation - a document of 1605 refers to a railway line from Birch Leasows, Broseley to the Calcutts, this is only the second railway for which evidence survives in England (making it one of the oldest railways in England).  A railway at the time would have horse drawn wagons on flanged wheels (meaning that greater loads could be moved with the same effort).

The Screw harnesses the power of the millrace to generate electricity, enough to light a bulb in every house in Ludlow and Ludford year round.

Whenever the river level is high enough, water is channelled into the top of the Screw, most of the generated electricity is fed into the National Grid.  The Screw design was chosen as it is the most wildlife friendly design.
