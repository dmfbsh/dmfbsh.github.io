# Name: Thomas 'Old Tom' Parr Born
- Date: 1483 AD

Thomas Parr was born at the Glyn in the township of Winnington within the chapelry of Great Wollaston (in the parish of Alberbury) in 1483.

According to the plaque he lived in the reigns of ten Kings and Queens of England and died on the 13th November 1635, aged 152 years and 9 months.  He is buried in Westminster Abbey.

A modern interpretation of the results of the autopsy suggests that Parr was probably less than 70 years of age.  It is possible that Parr's records were confused with those of his grandfather.

- Date: 1809 AD

William Penny Brookes was an English surgeon, magistrate, botanist, and educationalist.

Following the 1860 games, the Olympian Class was set up as the independent Wenlock Olympian Society.

Brookes' campaign for physical education brought him into contact with Baron Pierre de Coubertin - in 1890, the young French aristocrat visited Much Wenlock and stayed with Dr Brookes at his lifelong home in Wilmore Street.  Coubertin was inspired by discussions with Brookes and a games staged for his visit - in 1894 Coubertin set up the International Olympic Committee.
