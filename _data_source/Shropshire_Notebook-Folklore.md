# Date: Bronze Age
# Name: Mitchell's Fold

Sometimes called Medgel's Fold or Madges Pinfold, Mitchell's Fold is a Bronze Age stone circle. Its true history is unknown. This is one of three known stone circles in Shropshire.

The story of the Dun Cow is associated with Mitchell's Fold, in that according to traditional folklore Mitchell's Fold is where a giant kept a cow which gave unlimited amounts of milk. One day a witch milked the cow using a sieve until it had no more milk, as a result the cow fled to Warwickshire where it became the Dun Cow. The witch was turned to stone and surrounded by other stones to prevent escape.

Local folklore also suggests that Mitchell's Fold is the place where Arthur withdrew Excalibur from one of the stones.

# Date: 641 AD or 642 AD
# Name: St Oswald's Well, Oswestry

The Battle of Maserfield (or Maserfeld, "marsh (border) field"; Welsh: Maes Cogwy), was fought on 5 August 641 or 642, between the Anglo-Saxon kings Oswald of Northumbria and Penda of Mercia, ending in Oswald's defeat, death, and dismemberment.

An eagle (or raven) is said to have picked up Oswald's right arm and taken it to an ash tree, which gave the tree ageless vigor; when the bird dropped the arm onto the ground, a spring emerged from the ground. Both the tree and the spring were subsequently associated with healing miracles.

The name Oswestry literally means "Oswald’s tree". Oswald was canonised, his feast day is 5th August.
