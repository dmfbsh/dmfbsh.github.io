# Introduction
{: .mt-4}

My stamp collection is based on the theme of Formula 1.

The stamps are catalogued and recorded in an MS Access database.  The information is then published as a web site, organised to show the history of the sport.

The web site which depicts the history of Formula 1 using postage stamps is hosted on my GitHub Pages site at:

https://dmfbsh.github.io/

The web site is built using data extracted from the MS Access database.
