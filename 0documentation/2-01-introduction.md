# Introduction
{: .mt-4}

My stamp collection is based on the theme of Formula 1.

The stamps are catalogued and recorded in an MS Access database.

The information is then published as a web site, organised to show the history of the sport.

The Web Site is hosted in my GitHub repository:

`https://dmfbsh.github.io/`

It is a static site, generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), Jekyll is Ruby based.

The Web Site is developed using [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/) templates to define the presentation layout and data is contained in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) files.  The YAML files are generated from data extracted from the MS Access database.

All assets relating to the project are held in my GitHub repository, which is cloned to the OneDrive in the folder:

`C:\Users\David\Documents\OneDrive\Documents\My Documents\GitHub\dmfbsh.github.io`

The main tools for managing the workflow are:

- [XnViewMP](https://www.xnview.com/en/) (for handling the images)
- [UltraEdit](https://www.ultraedit.com/) (for handling the text-based files)
