# Introduction
{: .mt-4}

To learn more about the beautiful county of Shropshire, I use my photographs to investigate the history and explore the landscape.

My photographs are presented via a Web Site, which is organised into the following areas:

- History
- Landscape
- Castles
- Churches
- Houses
- People
- Folklore
- Places
- Gardens
- Other

The Web Site is hosted in my GitHub repository:

`https://dmfbsh.github.io/`

It is a static site, generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), Jekyll is Ruby based.

The Web Site is developed using [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/) templates to define the presentation layout and data is contained in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) files.  The YAML files are generated from [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files, this makes it easier to edit the source content.

All assets relating to the project are held in my GitHub repository, which is cloned to the OneDrive in the folder:

`C:\Users\David\Documents\OneDrive\Documents\My Documents\GitHub\dmfbsh.github.io`

The main tools for managing the workflow are:

- [XnViewMP](https://www.xnview.com/en/) (for handling the images)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (for handling the text-based files)
