# Add New Item
{: .mt-4}

The procedure to add a new item to the web site is as follows:

1. In XnViewMP select a photo for the item, this is from the ‘Originals’ folder of the photo collection – there is a favorite set up to allow easy access to the ‘Originals’ folder

    <img src="images/screen01.jpg" width="600"/>

2. Create a new record for the item in the AHK Shropshire Photography application, this will also create a folder in the directory:

    >`E:\My Pictures\Published\Shropshire`

    There are multiple ways to do this:

    - Select the original image in XnViewMP and launch the AHK Shropshire Photography application from the toolbar, this will prompt for a place name, select ‘New’ to create a new place

    <img src="images/screen02.jpg" width="300"/>

    <img src="images/screen03.jpg" width="300"/>

    <img src="images/screen04.jpg" width="600"/>

    - Create the record in the AHK Shropshire Photography application (using File > New), and then select the original image in XnViewMP and launch the AHK Shropshire Photography application from the toolbar, this will prompt for a place name, select the place name from the dropdown list

    <img src="images/screen05.jpg" width="300"/>

    - Create the record in the AHK Shropshire Photography application (using File > New), and then select the original image in the AHK Shropshire Photography application (using Image > Select)

3. In DxO PhotoLab develop the photo and export to disk using the Shropshire Photography output option

    <img src="images/screen06.jpg" width="600"/>

4. In the AHK Shropshire Photography application record any adjustments made in DxO PhotoLab

5. Move the developed photo to the item's folder - use the Move function in the AHK Shropshire Photography application to do this

6. Edit photo as required with Affinity Photo and / or Luminar and / or Landscape Pro

7. In the AHK Shropshire Photography application record any adjustments made in the photo editor(s)

8. Generate a thumbnail for each category to which the item is assigned to - for the history page the thumbnails are 400x400 and for all other pages the thumbnails are 500x500 - thumbnails are generated using an XnViewMP batch convert task:

    - Select the image

    - Select the action (two are defined)

    - Select the output folder (defined as favorites)

    <img src="images/screen07.jpg" width="600"/>

    <img src="images/screen08.jpg" width="600"/>

    <img src="images/screen09.jpg" width="600"/>

9. Add the item to the MD file for the page(s) on which it will feature – use the function in the AHK Shropshire Database application to generate a template (this will insert the correct filename for the photo)

10. Record the changes made to the Web Site in the updates log (markdown file)

## Additional Steps If  The Item Is A Church

1. Change the colour on Google map

    >[Google Maps](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/d/)

2. Change the status in the AHK Shropshire Churches application (this will automatically update the status (i.e. list) in Trello)

    <img src="images/screen10.jpg" width="600"/>

3. Use the AHK Shropshire Churches application to generate a new GPX file (for the UK Map app) – the GPX file should then be transferred to the iOS devices and loaded into the UK Map app

## Additional Steps If The Church Has Sub-Items

1. In XnViewMP identify any photos for the sub-images and assign the selected photos to the Church > Sub-Image category

2. In DxO PhotoLab develop the photos for the sub-images and export to disk using the Shropshire Photography output option

3. Add the filenames of the sub-images to the MD file entry for the church

4. Crop and resize the sub-images to be 240px high and save in the assets\images/churches-sub folder, open the photo in XnViewMP to crop it (if required), the resizing is done using an XnViewMP batch convert task, the original DxO files can then be deleted

# Update Photo

Sometimes it may be desirable to update the photo for an item, following this procedure:

1. Delete the photo(s) of the item in the item's folder in:

    >`E:\My Pictures\Published\Shropshire`

2. Delete the published versions of the photo from the appropriate folder(s) in:

    >`C:\Users\David\Documents\OneDrive\Documents\My Documents\GitHub\dmfbsh.github.io\1shropshire\assets\images`

3. Process the new photo as steps 1 to 10 above (but at step 2 just select the new original photo)
